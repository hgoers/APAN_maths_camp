You can make all kinds of very cool things with R, including websites, apps, slides, and more. In fact, all the resources I produced for this course were made using R and in RStudio, including this website and fancy slides.\nAnother advantage R has over other statistical programming languages is its accessibility. It is entirely free to use. There are many resources that are freely available that introduce you to its many uses. There is also an enthusiastic and welcoming community of R users who continue to grow R itself and the various resources you might need to expand your skills.",

I will now outline what you will learn in relation to R.\n\nYou will learn how to import your data into R. This includes how to load data stored in an external file, database, or online into a data frame in R.\nYou will then be introduced to methods for cleaning up those data. Oftentimes, data come to us in a messy format, with missingness, and inconsistencies. You will need to tidy it up into a format that is easy to work with and consistent.\nOnce you have tidy data, you will then need to transform it so that it is ready for your analysis. This includes focusing your data on the observations you are interested in and creating new variables.\nNext, we will focus on visualizing your data. You can learn a lot more about your data and relationships lurking within it from a plot than you can from looking at the raw numbers.\nWe will also spend a fair chunk of time learning how to model those relationships within our data. Alongside visualization, this is where R excels.\n\nFinally, I will also introduce you to tools for communicating your findings in an engaging and replicable way.\nA tour of RStudio\n\n\n\n\nExercises\nUsing the console, find the summation of 45, 978, and 121.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsum(45, 978, 121)\n\n[1] 1144\n\n\nOr:\n\n45 + 978 + 121\n\n[1] 1144\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is 67 divided by 6?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n67 / 6\n\n[1] 11.16667\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the square root of 894?

    "text": "The economic benefits of justice\nAppel and Loyle (2012) (two wonderful UMD alumni) explore the determinants of foreign direct investment (FDI) flows into and out of post-conflict states. States that are emerging from civil war often have an acute need for foreign and stable sources of capital. However, multinational corporations and other foreign commercial actors are likely to view post-conflict states as high risk countries in which to invest: the risk of a return to violence and instability is often high in the immediate aftermath of a civil war. Understanding this, leaders of post-conflict states often attempt to decrease this perceived risk.\nAppel and Loyle argue that leaders can successfully do this by establishing post-conflict justice (PCJ) institutions. These institutions impose both domestic and reputational costs on post-conflict leaders. These costs allow leaders to signal their commitment to minimizing the risk of a return to violence and instability to foreign commercial actors. This is a great paper and I highly encourage you to take a look at their argument in detail.\nTheir argument focuses on leaders’ attempts to change foreign commercial actors’ perceptions of the risk of a return to violence. We cannot directly observe these commercial actors’ perceptions. However, we can observe the outcome of these perceptions: investment. Firms that have the means and desire to invest in a post-conflict country will make an assessment of the risk to their investment before committing the capital required to set up shop. If they believe the country is highly likely to return to conflict, they will not invest in it. If, on the other hand, they believe the risk of recidivism is low, they will invest.\nIf Appel and Loyle’s argument is correct, we should observe higher levels of FDI investment coming into post-conflict states that establish PCJ institutions compared to those that do not. PCJ institutions reduce the risk of a return to violence, which should - in turn - reduce firms’ beliefs about this risk. Firms invest when they believe the risk of a return to conflict to be low.\nAppel and Loyle find strong evidence of this occuring. We will replicate and modify this empirical work. In doing so, we will become more familiar with the underlying mechanics of linear regression and strengthen our ability to interpret these models.\nLet’s get started!"

This is the period in which we would expect foreign commercial actors to perceive the risk of a return to violence and instability to be greatest and, therefore, the period in which leaders’ attempts to quash these perceptions to be most relevant.\nEach row in this data set represents a single post-conflict state. The data provided are a summary of the 10-years post-conflict. For example, net_fdi_inflows provides us with the total net FDI inflows (dollar amount invested in the country minus the dollar amount divested from the country) each post-conflict state received across the whole 10-year period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can learn more about each variable using the following command:\n\n?ebj\n\n\n\nTheir outcome of interest is net FDI inflows. Remember, if their argument is correct we would expect post-conflict states that have established a PCJ institution to have higher net FDI inflows than than states that did not. Let’s take a look at those net inflows:\n\nsummary(ebj$net_fdi_inflows)\n\n     Min.   1st Qu.    Median      Mean   3rd Qu.      Max. \n-1858.914    -0.572    38.290   759.146   408.250 24836.787 \n\n\n\nggplot(ebj, aes(x = net_fdi_inflows)) + \n  geom_histogram() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Net FDI inflows\",\n       y = \"Count\") + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn average, post-conflict countries received $759.15 million in net FDI inflow. So, countries in our sample tended to receive more investment than they lost in the 10-year period following the end of their conflict.\nLooking at the histogram above we can see that this average is not a particularly good summary of our data: the majority of countries received a smaller amount of net FDI inflows. The peak the distribution is sitting closer to $0. Looking at the five number summary printed above the histogram we can see that 50 percent of the countries in our sample received between -$0.57 and $408.25 million in net inflows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe middle 50 percent of a vector of numbers sits between the first quartile (below which 25 percent of those numbers fall) and the third quartile (below which 75 percent of those numbers fall). To illustrate, consider the following:\n\nx &lt;- seq(0, 100)\n\nsummary(x)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n      0      25      50      50      75     100 \n\n\n\n\nWhy is our average sitting so far above where the majority of the countries’ net FDI inflows fell? There appears to be a clear outlier in our data: Russia received a net FDI inflow of $24,836.79 million in the 10 years following the end of the First Chechen War in 1997. You can see that this is pulling the average net FDI inflows up well above the median inflow across our group of post-conflict states. Keep this in mind, because we will return to it later in the course."

Take a minute to interpret the intercept and coefficient estimate yourself. Can you see the connection to our simple grouped averages above?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your answer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe intercept is the predicted value of our outcome variable when all independent variables are equal to zero. Here, we have one independent variable which is equal to zero when the country did not establish PCJ institutions. Our model predicts that post-conflict countries without PCJ institutions will have the net FDI inflow that post-conflict countries in our sample without PCJ institutions had on average.\nThe coefficient estimate is the predicted average difference in the outcome following a one-unit change in the independent variable. Here, a one-unit change in our independent variable is a move from no PCJ institutions (where pcj = 0) to at least one PCJ institution (where pcj = 1). Our model predicts that post-conflict countries with PCJ institutions will have on average $1,763.52 million more in net FDI inflows because this is the difference between the average net inflows of countries in our sample without PCJ institutions and those with them.\n\n\n\nAccording to this model, what is the average predicted net FDI inflows for countries that did not establish PCJ institution?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-conflict states that did not establish a PCJ institution received, on average, net FDI inflows of $425.01 million in the 10-year period after conflict.\nTo get this, I looked at the intercept coefficient which tells us the average predicted value of our outcome variable when all explanatory variables are equal to zero or their baseline category.\n\n\n\nAccording to this model, what is the average predicted net FDI inflows for countries that did establish PCJ institution?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, states that did establish PCJ institution received, on average, net FDI inflows of $2,188.52 million.\nIn other words:\n\\[\nAverage\\ net\\ FDI\\ inflows = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Institution\\ established + \\epsilon\n\\]\nWhen an institution was established (i.e. \\(Institution\\ established = 1\\)):\n\\[\nAverage\\ net\\ FDI\\ inflows = 425.01 + 1763.52 * 1 + \\epsilon \\\\\n\\]\n\\[\nAverage\\ net\\ FDI\\ inflows = 2188.52\n\\]\n\n\n\nSubstantive significance\nSo, we found support for Appel and Loyal’s hypothesis: countries that established PCJ institutions within the first five-years after conflict received more net FDI inflows than those that did not establish these institutions. But, was this difference large? These institutions impose real costs on post-conflict leaders. Is the predicted boost in net FDI inflows generally worth this cost? More generally, is this difference substantively significant?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSubstantive significance is different from statistical significance, which we will discuss in detail in our last session. Here, we are interested in whether the difference is large enough for our political actors to care about it.\nTo illustrate, imagine if I told you that studying this course material for an additional five hours would lead to a one-point increase in your quiz mark. I’m not sure many of you would put in that additional work for such a small reward. If, on the other hand, I told you that it would boost your mark by 15 points, you might be more willing to spend your afternoon with these materials.\nThere is no one right or wrong answer to the question of substantive significance. For example, perhaps someone who is one point away from a perfect grade would be willing to put in the extra hours to secure that one additional mark. Substantive significance rests much more on your argument for it, rather than a hard-and-fast threshold that must be reached (which is the case for statistical significance).\n\n\nI argue that this finding is substantively significant. These countries are recovering from conflict: their economies are generally very weak. Leaders are often very keen to find stable and reliable sources of funding to promote and strengthen their battered economies. This average difference of $1,763.52 million is; therefore, likely to incentivize this policy."

    "text": "But what about other factors that shape net FDI inflows?\nOne of Appel and Loyle’s major contributions is their critique of approaches to estimating net FDI inflows that focus only on economic factors. They argue that there are several political factors that are significant determinants of other countries’ and foreign firms’ willingness to invest in these war-torn countries.\nThis critique is very valid, but it suggests that there are many different things influencing this outcome of interest, including economic factors. We have only looked at the political! The economists might turn around and accuse us of doing the very thing Appel and Loyle accused them of!\nLet’s add some of those economic factors into our model. We will start with an intuitive one: individuals’ economic wealth (measured as GDP per capita). I expect that foreign firms will be more willing to invest larger sums of money into economies with richer citizens. These citizens will be more willing and able to purchase the goods and services provided by those firms.\nTherefore, I hypothesize that the greater a state’s GDP per capita, the larger its net FDI inflows. I expect this to be the case regardless of whether the state has established a PCJ institution. Let’s test this claim:\n\nm &lt;- lm(net_fdi_inflows ~ pcj + gdp_per_capita, data = ebj)\n\nmodelsummary(m, \n             statistic = NULL, \n             coef_rename = c(\"pcjPCJ institutions\" = \"PCJ institutions established\",\n                             \"gdp_per_capita\" = \"GDP per capita (current USD)\"))\n\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n \n                (1)\n              \n\n\n(Intercept)\n                  -319.173\n                \n\nPCJ institutions established\n                  1673.288\n                \n\nGDP per capita (current USD)\n                  0.318\n                \n\nNum.Obs.\n                  95\n                \n\nR2\n                  0.142\n                \n\nR2 Adj.\n                  0.124\n                \n\nAIC\n                  1777.5\n                \n\nBIC\n                  1787.7\n                \n\nLog.Lik.\n                  -884.742\n                \n\nRMSE\n                  2681.52\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe continue to find a positive relationship between net FDI inflows and the establishment of a PCJ institution. In other words, countries that established PCJ institutions received, on average, larger net FDI inflows than those that did not establish these institutions. Additionally, we can now state that this is the case regardless of how rich or poor individuals within the country are.\nWe do this by holding constant the other variables in the model. This can be a little tricky to wrap your head around, so please be patient with yourselves. When we introduce multiple variables into our linear regression models we move from a line of best fit to a plane of best fit. You add an additional dimension to your plane for each additional variable you include in your model. To illustrate, look at the model we just fit (which has two variables) plotted against the observed values for whether the country had a PCJ institution, its GDP per capita, and the net FDI inflow it received:\n\nShow the code# You can produce interactive graphs in R using `plotly`.

Have a play around with it.\n\n\nOur model is no longer the line of best fit. It is now the linear plane of best fit. For any given value of GDP per capita and whether the country has PCJ institutions or not, we have a predicted value of net FDI inflows. This predicted value is the value that minimizes the distance between itself and all the values of both GDP per capita and whether the country has a PCJ institution or not.\nInterpreting multiple linear regression models\nThe intercept here is not informative on its own. It tells us the estimated average net FDI inflows for countries that do not have PCJ institutions (pcj = 0) and in which citizens had a GDP per capita of $0 (gdp_per_capita = 0). Although the majority of countries did not establish a PCJ institution, there are no countries in the world that have a GDP per capita of $0.\nLet’s instead focus on the other coefficients. We find that states that established a PCJ institution received, on average, net FDI inflows of $1,673.29 million more than states that did not, holding that country’s GDP per capita constant. I have picked one value of GDP per capita and then calculated the difference between the predicted value of net FDI inflows for a countries with that GDP per capita and without PCJ institutions compared to that for a country with that GDP per capita and with PCJ institutions. The value of GDP per capita that you pick does not matter because this is a linear plane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo illustrate, say I pick a GDP per capita of $0. The predicted net FDI inflow for a country without a PCJ institution is therefore:\n\\[\nNet\\ inflow = -319 + \\beta_{PCJ}(0) + \\beta_{GDP\\ per\\ cap}(0) \\\\\nNet\\ inflow = -319 + 1673(0) + 0.318(0) \\\\\nNet\\ inflow = -319\n\\]\nThe predicted net FDI inflow for a country with a PCJ institution (and a GDP per capita of $0) is:\n\\[\nNet\\ inflow = -319 + \\beta_{PCJ}(1) + \\beta_{GDP\\ per\\ cap}(0) \\\\\nNet\\ inflow = -319 + 1673(1) + 0.318(0)\nNet\\ inflow = 1354\n\\]\nThe difference is $1673 (the coefficient for the PCJ variable).\nI can do the same calculations for a country with a GDP per capita of $25,000. Here is the predicted net FDI inflow for a country without PCJ institutions:\n\\[\nNet\\ inflow = -319 + 1673(0) + 0.318(25000) \\\\\nNet\\ inflow = 7631\n\\]\nAnd for a country with PCJ institutions:\n\\[\nNet\\ inflow = -319 + 1673(1) + 0.318(25000) \\\\\nNet\\ inflow = 9304\n\\]\nAgain, the difference is $1673 (the coefficient for the PCJ variable).\n\n\nWe also find that an increase in the GDP per capita of a state of $1,000 is associated with an increase of $318.45 million in net FDI inflow, on average and holding whether they have PCJ institutions constant. This is consistent with our expectations that, holding all else constant, a country with a richer population is a more attractive investment destination than a country that has poorer citizens.\nUsing this richer model\nWe now have a richer understanding of the determinants of net FDI inflows to post-conflict countries. We have accounted for both economic and political determinants of those flows. Although it is often useful to look at the estimated relationship of each of those variables individually (as we did just above), we often learn more by looking at the whole model in context.\nAs usual, one of the easiest ways to communicate this is through a visualization. Let’s look at the predicted net FDI inflows for post-conflict countries that established and did not establish PCJ institutions across a range of plausible GDP per capita values:\n\nplot_predictions(m, condition = c(\"gdp_per_capita\", \"pcj\")) + \n  labs(x = \"GDP per capita (USD)\",\n       y = \"Net FDI inflows (USD million)\",\n       color = \"PCJ\",\n       fill = \"PCJ\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that countries with PCJ institutions (represented by the blue line) are predicted to have more net FDI inflows than countries without these institutions (represented by the red line) across all values of GDP per capita. Because the model is linear, the distance between the red and blue lines is constant across all values of GDP per capita.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe coloured bands around the line showing the predicted values of net FDI inflows are the confidence intervals. We will discuss these more in later sessions.\n\n\nThe full model\nAppel and Loyle control for many more economic and political factors shaping net FDI inflows. Remember, they are arguing that the extensive literature that looks at the determinants of FDI flows to post-conflict states failed to account for this important political factor. However, that same literature did a very good job of identifying the economic factors, including countries’ economic development, size, and growth rates, that shape this outcome. They don’t dispute that these factors are also important, they just argue that we should also think about the role PCJ institutions play in shaping foreign firms’ beliefs about the risk of returning to violence.\nSo, let’s account for these other factors:\n\nm &lt;- lm(net_fdi_inflows ~ pcj + gdp_per_capita + gdp + gdp_per_capita_growth + \n          cap_account_openness + ex_rate_fluc + labor + f_life_exp + \n          pol_constraints + polity2 + damage + conflict_duration + peace_agreement + \n          victory + cold_war, \n        data = ebj)\n\nmodelsummary(m, \n             statistic = NULL, \n             coef_rename = c(\"pcjPCJ institutions\" = \"PCJ institutions established\",\n                             \"gdp_per_capita\" = \"GDP per capita (current USD)\",\n                             \"gdp\" = \"GDP (current USD)\",\n                             \"gdp_per_capita_growth\" = \"GDP per capita growth rate (%)\",\n                             \"cap_account_openness\" = \"Capital account openness\",\n                             \"ex_rate_fluc\" = \"Exchange rate fluctuation\",\n                             \"labor\" = \"Labor force participation (%)\",\n                             \"f_life_exp\" = \"Average female life expectancy (years)\",\n                             \"pol_constraints\" = \"Political constraints\",\n                             \"polity2\" = \"Regime type (Polity score)\",\n                             \"damage\" = \"Pre-conflict GDP lost\",\n                             \"conflict_duration\" = \"Conflict duration (years)\",\n                             \"peace_agreementPeace agreement\" = \"Peace agreement\",\n                             \"victoryVictory\" = \"Decisive victory\",\n                             \"cold_warCold War\" = \"Cold War\"))\n\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n \n                (1)\n              \n\n\n(Intercept)\n                  -1278.322\n                \n\nPCJ institutions established\n                  1960.282\n                \n\nGDP per capita (current USD)\n                  -0.111\n                \n\nGDP (current USD)\n                  0.000\n                \n\nGDP per capita growth rate (%)\n                  37.400\n                \n\nCapital account openness\n                  198.823\n                \n\nExchange rate fluctuation\n                  -42.516\n                \n\nLabor force participation (%)\n                  9.844\n                \n\nAverage female life expectancy (years)\n                  3.475\n                \n\nPolitical constraints\n                  2557.954\n                \n\nRegime type (Polity score)\n                  -90.169\n                \n\nPre-conflict GDP lost\n                  28.379\n                \n\nConflict duration (years)\n                  0.811\n                \n\nPeace agreement\n                  -1215.137\n                \n\nDecisive victory\n                  -33.969\n                \n\nCold War\n                  81.531\n                \n\nNum.Obs.\n                  95\n                \n\nR2\n                  0.514\n                \n\nR2 Adj.\n                  0.422\n                \n\nAIC\n                  1749.5\n                \n\nBIC\n                  1792.9\n                \n\nLog.Lik.\n                  -857.752\n                \n\nRMSE\n                  2018.34\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven when we account for all the political, economic, and conflict-related factors that the literature previously identified to be important, we still find that the existence of PCJ institution shapes the net FDI inflows of post-conflict states."

    "text": "Including categorical variables with multiple categories\nAppel and Loyle look at a number of political factors driving net FDI inflows to post-conflict states. They include a measure of regime type: the country’s Polity score. This score measures a state’s regime type along a 21-point scale from -10 (perfect autocracy) to 10 (perfect democracy). Broadly speaking, political scientists have usefully broken this spectrum down into three regime types: democracies, hybrid regimes, and autocracies.\nLet’s modify their measure of regime type to reflect these broad categories, instead of treating it as a continuous variable:\n\nebj &lt;- ebj |&gt; \n  mutate(regime_type = case_when(polity2 &gt; 5 ~ \"Democracy\",\n                                 polity2 &lt; -5 ~ \"Autocracy\",\n                                 TRUE ~ \"Hybrid regime\"),\n         regime_type = factor(regime_type, levels = c(\"Autocracy\",\n                                                      \"Hybrid regime\",\n                                                      \"Democracy\")))\n\nI have a theoretical reason to do this. I suspect that there is not a clear linear relationship between investors’ confidence in a post-conflict state and its regime type when we treat regime type as a continuous spectrum moving linearly from autocracies to democracies. In other words, I don’t think that moving one Polity score away from being an autocracy to being a democracy would have a consistent effect on investor confidence (and; therefore, net FDI inflows). Appel and Loyle’s model agrees with me: the regime type variable is not statistically significant.\nRather, I suspect that strong democracies and strong autocracies provide the political stability required to comfort foreign investors. These investors believe that the strong control democrats and autocrats have over their citizens and institutions reduces the risk that the country will re-enter into conflict. However, hybrid regimes do not tend to have this level of control. Investors are; therefore, less likely to invest in post-conflict countries with hybrid regimes.\nLet’s test this!\nWe now have a categorical variable with three categories: democracy, hybrid regime, and autocracy. We have thus far largely dealt with binary categorical variables (voted or not, Southern or not, female or not). How do we use and interpret multiple categorical variables in regression analysis?\nHappily, the intuition remains the same as with our binary categorical variables. We hold one category out as our baseline category and then compare the associated effects of the other categories to this one.\nLet’s step through that using a stripped back version of our model:\n\nm &lt;- lm(net_fdi_inflows ~ pcj + regime_type, data = ebj)\n\nmodelsummary(m, \n             coef_rename = c(\"pcjPCJ institutions\" = \"PCJ institutions established\",\n                             \"regime_typeDemocracy\" = \"Democracy\",\n                             \"regime_typeHybrid regime\" = \"Hybrid\"),\n             stars = T)\n\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n \n                (1)\n              \n+ p \n\n\n(Intercept)\n                  214.555\n                \n\n\n                  (497.984)\n                \n\nPCJ institutions established\n                  1816.169*\n                \n\n\n                  (764.093)\n                \n\nHybrid\n                  553.893\n                \n\n\n                  (667.644)\n                \n\nDemocracy\n                  -148.124\n                \n\n\n                  (809.623)\n                \n\nNum.Obs.\n                  95\n                \n\nR2\n                  0.068\n                \n\nR2 Adj.\n                  0.037\n                \n\nAIC\n                  1787.4\n                \n\nBIC\n                  1800.1\n                \n\nLog.Lik.\n                  -888.688\n                \n\nRMSE\n                  2795.25\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll note that autocracies are missing from our regression table. This is because they are being held out as our baseline category. Their effect on net FDI inflows is captured by the intercept coefficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe often say that the intercept coefficient represents the predicted average value of our outcome of interest when all independent variables are set to zero. It might be useful for you to think of your baseline category as taking on the value zero. For example, we can think of autocracy = 0.\n\n\nOur model suggests that autocracies (regime_type = \"Autocracy\") that have not established a commission (pcj = \"No institutions\") have a predicted average net FDI inflow of $214.55 million.\nThe coefficients on democracies and hybrid regimes need to be interpreted in relation to autocracies (their baseline category). From our model, we can see that the coefficient for democracies is negative and the coefficient for hybrid regimes is positive. That means that, on average, democracies tend to receive less net FDI inflows than autocracies and hybrid regimes tend to receive more net FDI inflows than autocracies, holding all else constant.\nPredictions with multiple categorical variables\nUsing our model, what do we predict to be the net FDI inflows for democracies, autocracies, and hybrid regimes that either have a PCJ institutions or do not?\nFirst, let’s create a table with each possible combination of these two variables of interest:\n\nnew_data &lt;- tibble(pcj = factor(c(\"No institutions\", \n                                  \"PCJ institutions\"))) |&gt; \n  cross_join(\n    tibble(regime_type = factor(c(\"Autocracy\", \"Democracy\", \"Hybrid regime\")))\n  )\n\nnew_data\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  pcj              regime_type  \n  &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;fct&gt;        \n1 No institutions  Autocracy    \n2 No institutions  Democracy    \n3 No institutions  Hybrid regime\n4 PCJ institutions Autocracy    \n5 PCJ institutions Democracy    \n6 PCJ institutions Hybrid regime\n\n\nThen we can use our model to predict what we expect a hypothetical state with each of these combinations of characteristics to receive in net FDI inflows:\n\npred &lt;- augment(m, newdata = new_data)\n\npred\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  pcj              regime_type   .fitted\n  &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;fct&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 No institutions  Autocracy       215. \n2 No institutions  Democracy        66.4\n3 No institutions  Hybrid regime   768. \n4 PCJ institutions Autocracy      2031. \n5 PCJ institutions Democracy      1883. \n6 PCJ institutions Hybrid regime  2585. \n\n\nThat’s a bit unweildy. Let’s visualize it!\n\nggplot(pred, aes(x = .fitted, y = pcj, colour = regime_type)) + \n  geom_point(size = 5) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Predicted net FDI inflows (USD, million)\",\n       y = NULL, \n       colour = \"Regime type\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can clearly see that states that established PCJ institutions received, on average, larger net FDI inflows than states that did not, no matter their regime type. Further and completely counter to my hypothesis, hybrid regimes have, on average, the highest net FDI inflows compared to democracies and autocracies even when we account for whether the state has a PCJ institution.\nI’m not too worried: none of these coefficients are anywhere close to being statistically significant. I suspect that there is a more complex relationship underlying commercial actors’ beliefs about the stability of hybrid regimes, democracies, and autocracies and its effect on net investment flows. But I hope this serves as a good illustration of how we can use multiple categorical variables in our analyses."

It will also already contain some text and code. Most of this is demonstrative and can be deleted. However, the top section is very important and should be kept. This section (written in YAML) includes the metadata for your document. By default, it includes the title, author, format in which it will rendered, and the default RStudio editor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nSwitch your output (format) from HTML to PDF by changing html to pdf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA full list of the formats to which you can render your Quarto document is provided here.\n\n\n\nThere are two ways to work with and view Quarto documents. The default editor is visual, which follows a more “what-you-see-is-what-you-get” style. If you have worked a lot with MS Word documents or Google Docs, this interface will look familiar. Alternatively, you can edit in source, which looks more like a raw script. To switch between the two, you can use the Source and Visual icons in the top left hand side of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI find myself switching between these two formats all the time. The visual editor is much easier to work in when writing, but it can be a bit buggy when it comes to writing code. I work in source when I am writing and running R code."

    "section": "Running code in Quarto",
    "text": "Running code in Quarto\nYou can also run code from within your Quarto document. You can do this through a code chunk or in-line code. I will step through both options now.\n\nCode chunks\nA code chunk starts with ```{r} and ends with ```. You can then write whole “chunks” of code that will output in your rendered document.\nFor example, I will load the tidyverse R package into my current session:\n```{r}\n#| echo: true\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\nYou can specify your chunk options using #| at the start of the line. For example, above I specified that I wanted the code in the code chunk to be shown when I render my document. You can hide the code by changing the chunk option echo to false. There are many different chunk options that you can control. A full list can be found here.\nYou can set the chunk options in the individual chunks, as show above. Alternatively, you can set them universally in the YAML section at the top of your Quarto document using the execute command. For example:\n```{yaml}\nexecute:\n  echo: true\n  message: false\n  warning: false\n```\nThis will apply to all code chunks unless you overwrite it by including chunk-specific options in a code chunk.\nCode chunks are useful for running large amounts of code. Commonly, I use them to include a plot, a regression table, or to read in my data or model results. For example, you can write the code to create a ggplot directly in your document.\n\n\n\nSource: Quarto\n\n\n\n\nIn-line code\nYou will often want to reference numbers or results in your prose. For example, I may be writing up the data section of a paper and want to specify that my data set includes 100 observations. If I were to write this in normally and then go away and collect more data, I would need to come back and update this number manually to reflect my new number of observations. I may do this several times (very tedious) or I may miss a time (we are all human). In-line coding allows you to make these updates programmatically.\nYou include R code directly in your prose using the expression: r. For example:\n\nWill render as: There are r nrow(mpg) observations in our data. No need to go and update this reference if that number changes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nscales is a great R package for formatting numbers.\nFor example, R will output raw numbers such as 1000000000 and 8932348920. scales allows you to format these numbers so they are easier to read: scales::comma(1000000000) gives you r scales::comma(1000000000) and scales::dollar(8932348920) gives you r scales::dollar(8932348920).\n\n\nYou can use Quarto to produce all kinds of fully reproducible documents, including journal articles and reports. You can also use it to produce very professional-looking presentations. Finally, you can even use it to produce websites. In fact, all of the resources provided to you here were produced in Quarto."

    "text": "Are election monitors effective at reducing election-day fraud in new democracies?\nHyde was very interested in election fraud. She wanted to uncover what things the international community could do to prevent elections from being stolen. Interestingly for her, she completed her PhD during a time in which the prevalence of international election monitors exploded. There was a sharp increase in the number of elections held in new democracies globally that included international organizations or representatives from other countries monitoring how those elections were run. So, she wanted to know: did these international monitors cause less election-day fraud in democratic elections?\nShe worked out that, although fraud itself is very difficult to see, its outcome is not. (Effective) cheating parties receive a greater vote share than they would had they not cheated. So she set out to see whether international election monitors camped out at election booths decreased the vote share won by cheating parties at those booths. In her own words (Hyde 2007, 39):\n\nIf the presence of international observers causes a reduction in election-day fraud, the effect of observers should be visible at the subnational level by comparing polling stations that were visited by observers with those that were not visited. More specifically, if international monitoring reduces election day fraud directly, all else held equal, the cheating parties should gain less of their ill-gotten vote share in polling stations that were visited by international monitors.\n\nSo, Hyde offers the following sequence of causes:\n\nInternational election monitors cause …\nLess election-day fraud at the booth at which they are stationed (which we cannot observe directly), which causes …\nA lower vote-share won by the cheating party than they would otherwise have won (which we can observe directly, kind of … stay tuned)."

    "text": "Causal relationships\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nJargon incoming!\n\n\nHyde is interested in the causal relationship between international election monitors and election-day fraud. Formally, a causal relationship refers to the directional connection between a change in one variable and a corresponding change in another.\nFor causal relationships, direction really matters. You need to prove the following sequence of events:\n\nA change happened to some factor, then:\nA change happened to your outcome of interest\n\nLet’s label these factors to avoid confusion. The treatment variable is the variable causing changes to another variable. It’s the one that moves first. The outcome variable is the variable changing as a result of changes to another variable (the treatment). It’s the one that moves second.\nHyde wanted to test whether the presence of international monitors (the treatment) leads to less election day fraud (the outcome).\nFocus for a moment on the treatment variable. At any given polling station in any given election, monitors may be: 1) present, or 2) not present. We, therefore, have two conditions:\n\nTreatment: monitors are present\nControl: monitors are not present"

    "text": "Individual causal effects\nWe want to know whether the treatment causes a change in our outcome of interest. To do this, we want to compare the vote share the cheating party received at the voting booth with election monitors present (under treatment) to that it received at the voting booth without election monitors present (under control). Huh…\nLet’s step through this with a concrete example. Imagine that we are looking at a specific election held within a new democracy. There are 1,000 election booths set up for the election.\nIn an ideal world, we would run the election with no monitors and record the vote share each party received at each booth. We would then jump in our very handy time machine and go back to the start of the election. We would station monitors at every booth, run the election, and record the vote share each party received.\nWe could then directly compare the vote share each party received at each booth with and without monitors (in treatment and control). If Hyde’s hypothesis is correct, we should see that the cheating party receives a lower vote share in the timeline with election monitors than it does in the timeline without them.\nFor example, imagine that the following results were recorded for the cheating party at each of the 1,000 booths in both timelines:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the only difference between these two versions of the election was the presence of election monitors, we can definitively state that the difference in vote shares won by each party was caused by the monitors. Let’s calculate those differences:\n\nindiv_effect_df |&gt; \n  mutate(across(vote_share_monitored:difference, \n                ~ scales::percent(.x, accuracy = 0.1))) |&gt; \n  rename(ID = polling_station_id,\n         `Monitored vote %` = vote_share_monitored,\n         `Non-monitored vote %` = vote_share_not_monitored,\n         Difference = difference) |&gt; \n  datatable(rownames = F, options = list(pageLength = 10, dom = 'tip'))\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this hypothetical election, these differences are substantial! They are often the difference between a decisive victory and an embarrassing defeat."

We cannot, therefore, calculate the difference and identify the causal effect of election monitors for each individual booth. So, now what?\nWe need to move away from looking at individual booths and start to look for patterns in our group of observations. Let’s return to our two timelines.

For each booth, I flipped a (R generated) coin to decide whether that booth would be monitored. At the end of that process, roughly half of the booths had monitors and half did not:\n\n\n\n\nMonitored\nNo. of booths\n\n\n\nNo\n502\n\n\nYes\n498\n\n\n\n\n\nThe magic trick with random assignment is that you tend to end up with two groups that are roughly identical to one another prior to treatment, on average. Remember, our goal is to create two groups (treatment and control) that are identical to one another prior to treatment. If the only difference between the groups is the treatment, we can say that any differences in our outcome of interest is caused by the treatment.\nAbsent a time machine, we then need to set about creating two groups that are as identical to each other as possible. It turns out that random assignment does a very good job of achieving this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPractitioners have come up with other clever ways of doing this, including pairwise matching. We will not cover those in this course.\n\n\nYou don’t need to take my word for this. Let’s prove it with simulation! Imagine we have a group of 1,000 individuals. We know the following about them:\n\nHeight\nWeight\nEye colour\n\nHere are those data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m now going to flip a (imaginary, R-generated) coin for each of these 1,000 individuals to assigned them to either group A or B:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can check how similar these two groups are to one another. Let’s start with their heights:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of heights among individuals in groups A and B are roughly identical. The average height of individuals in group A is 170.1 cm and in group B is 170 cm. Pretty neat!\nLet’s check their weight:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the distribution of weights among individuals in groups A and B are roughly identical. On average, individuals in group A weigh 79.9 kg. Individuals in group B weigh 79.6 kg, on average.\nFinally, let’s look at eye colour:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, the proportion of individuals within each group with each eye colour are roughly identical. This is all due to random assignment.\nLet’s repeat this process, assigning our 1,000 individuals randomly to each group, and make sure this wasn’t a fluke:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd let’s see how similar these new, randomly-assigned groups are to each other:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, these two groups are nearly identical to one another, on average. In fact, if we did this many, many, many times, these groups would be, on average, increasingly identical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\n\nBecause of the Central Limit Theorem and Law of Large Numbers. We will talk about these two concepts later in the course."

    "text": "How will what you learn this session help your research?\nYou have an interesting question that you want to explore. You have some data that relate to that question. Included in these data are information on your outcome of interest and information on the things that you think determine or shape that outcome. You think that one (or more) of the drivers is particularly important, but no one has yet written about it or proven its importance. Brilliant! What do you do now?\nThe first step in any empirical analysis is getting to know your data. I mean, really getting to know your data. You want to dig into it with a critical eye. You want to understand any patterns lurking beneath the surface.\nUltimately, you want to get a really good understanding of the data generation process. This process can be thought of in two different and important ways. First, you want to understand how, out there in the real world, your outcome and drivers come to be. For example, if you are interested in voting patterns, you want to know the nitty gritty process of how people actually vote. Do they have to travel long distances, stand in long queues, fill out a lot of paperwork? Are there age restrictions on their ability to vote? Are there more insidious restrictions that might suppress voting for one particular group in the electorate?\nYou can use the skills we will discuss in this section to help you answer these questions. For example, you can determine whether there are relatively few young voters compared to older voters. If so, why? In turn, your growing expertise in and understanding of the data generation process should inform your exploration of the data. You might note that people have to wait in long queues on a Tuesday to vote. Does this impact the number of workers vs. retirees who vote?\nNow, this is made slightly more tricky by the second part of this process. You need to understand how your variables are actually measured. How do we know who turns out to vote? Did you get access to the voter file, which records each individual who voted and some interesting and potentially relevant demographic information about them? Or are you relying on exit polls, that only include a portion of those who voted? Were the people included in the polls reflective of the total voting population? What or whom is missing from this survey? Of course, if your sample is not representative, you might find some patterns that appear to be very important to your outcome of interest but are, in fact, just an artifact of a poorly drawn sample. If your survey failed to get responses from young people, you may be led to falsely believe that young people don’t vote.\nThis session you will be introduced to the first part of the data analysis process: data exploration. We use descriptive statistics to summarize patterns in our data. These are powerful tools that will inform you of the shape of your variables of interest. With this knowledge, you will start to answer your important question and potentially identify new ones. You will also be able to sense-check your more complex models and pick up on odd or incorrect relationships that they may find.\nAs you make your frequency tables and histograms and very elaborate dot plots and box charts, keep in mind that these tools are useful for your interrogation of the data generation process. Be critical. Continue to ask whether your data allow you to detect true relationships between your variables of interest. Build your intuition for what is really going on and what factors are really driving your outcome of interest.\nLet’s get started.",

    "text": "Describing your data\nBroadly, there are two types of variables: categorical and continuous variables.\nCategorical variables are discrete. They can be unordered (nominal) - for example, the different colours of cars - or ordered (ordinal) - for example, whether you strongly dislike, dislike, are neutral about, like, or strongly like Taylor Swift.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDichotomous (or binary) variables are a special type of categorical variable. They take on one of two values. For example: yes or no; at war or not at war; is a Swifty, or is not a Swifty.\n\n\nContinuous variables are, well, continuous. For example, your height or weight, a country’s GDP or population, or the number of fatalities in a battle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nContinuous variables can be made into (usually ordered) categorical variables. This process is called binning. For example, you can take individuals’ ages and reduce them to 0 - 18 years old, 18 - 45 years old, 45 - 65 years old, and 65+ years old.\nYou lose information in this process: you cannot go from 45 - 65 years old back to the individuals’ precise age. In other words, you cannot go from a categorical to continuous variable.\n\n\nLet’s take a look at how you can describe these different types of variables using real-world political science examples.",

    "text": "Describing categorical variables\nGenerally, we can get a good sense of a categorical variable by looking at counts or proportions. For example, which category contains the most number of observations? Which contains the least?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLater, we will ask interesting questions using these summaries. These include whether differences between the counts and/or percentages of cases that fall into each category are meaningfully (and/or statistically significantly) different from one another. This deceptively simple question serves as the foundation for a lot of empirical research.\n\n\nLet’s use the American National Election Survey to explore how to produce useful descriptive statistics for categorical variables using R. The ANES surveys individual US voters prior to and just following US Presidential Elections. It asks them about their political beliefs and behavior.\nWe can access the latest survey (from the 2020 Presidential Election) using the polisciols package:\n\npolisciols::nes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nTake a look at the different pieces of information collected about each respondent by running ?nes in your console.\n\n\nLet’s look at US voters’ views on income inequality in the US. Specifically, we will look at whether individuals think the difference in incomes between rich people and poor people in the United States today is larger, smaller, or about the same as it was 20 years ago.\nRespondents could provide one of four answers (or refuse to answer the question, which is marked as NA):\n\ndistinct(nes, income_gap)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 1\n  income_gap    \n  &lt;ord&gt;         \n1 About the same\n2 Larger        \n3 Smaller       \n4 &lt;NA&gt;          \n5 Don't know    \n\n\nThis is an ordinal categorical variable. It is discrete and ordered. We can take a look at the variable itself using the helpful skimr::skim() function:\n\nskim(nes$income_gap)\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nnes$income_gap\n\n\nNumber of rows\n8280\n\n\nNumber of columns\n1\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\nfactor\n1\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: factor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nordered\nn_unique\ntop_counts\n\n\ndata\n54\n0.99\nTRUE\n4\nLar: 6117, Abo: 1683, Sma: 416, Don: 10\n\n\n\n\nFrom this, we learn that:\n\nWe have information on nrow(nes) |&gt; comma() observations (or respondents)\nThe variable type is a factor (see the R tip below)\nWe are missing 54 observations (in other words, 54 people did not answer the question)\nThis means that we have information on 99% of our observations (from complete_rate).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRemember, there are many different types of data that R recognizes. These include characters (\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"), integers (1, 2, 3), and logical values (TRUE or FALSE). R treats categorical variables as factors.\n\n\nFrequency distribution\nWhat count and proportion of respondents provided each answer? We can take advantage of janitor::tabyl() to quickly calculate this:\n\ntabyl(nes, income_gap)\n\n     income_gap    n     percent valid_percent\n     Don't know   10 0.001207729   0.001215658\n        Smaller  416 0.050241546   0.050571359\n About the same 1683 0.203260870   0.204595186\n         Larger 6117 0.738768116   0.743617797\n           &lt;NA&gt;   54 0.006521739            NA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nvalid_percent provides the proportion of respondents who provided each answer with missing values removed from the denominator. For example, the ANES surveyed 8,280 respondents in 2020, but only 8,226 of them answered this question.\n6,117 responded that they believe the income gap is larger today than it was 20 years ago. Therefore, the Larger proportion (which is bounded by 0 and 1, whereas percentages are bounded by 0 and 100) is 6,117 / 8,280 and its valid proportion is 6117 / 8,226.\n\n\nVisualizing this frequency\nIt is a bit difficult to quickly determine relative counts. Which was the most popular answer? Which was the least? Are these counts very different from each other?\nVisualizing your data will give you a much better sense of it. I recommend using a bar chart to show clearly relative counts.\n\nggplot(nes, aes(y = income_gap)) + \n  geom_bar() +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Count of respondents\",\n    y = NULL,\n    caption = \"Source: ANES 2020 Survey\"\n  ) + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_comma())\n\n\n\nDo you think the difference in incomes between rich people and poor people in the United States today is larger, smaller, or about the same as it was 20 years ago?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\ngeom_bar() automatically counts the number of observations in each category.\n\n\nFrom this plot we quickly learn that a large majority of respondents believe that the income gap has grown over the last 20 years. Very few people believe it has shrunk.",

    "text": "Describing continuous variables\nWe need to treat continuous variables differently from categorical ones. Continuous variables cannot meaningfully be bound together and compared. For example, imagine making a frequency table or bar chart that counts the number of countries with each observed GDP. You would have 193 different counts of one. Not very helpful!\nWe can get a much better sense of our continuous variables by looking at how they are distributed across the range of all possible values they could take on. Phew! Let’s make sense of this using some real-world data.\nFor this section, we will look at how much each country spends on education as a proportion of its gross domestic product (GDP). We will use wbstats::wb_data() to collect these data directly from the World Bank’s data portal.\n\nperc_edu &lt;- wb_data(\n  \"SE.XPD.TOTL.GD.ZS\", start_date = 2020, end_date = 2020, return_wide = F\n) |&gt; \n  transmute(\n    country, \n    region = countrycode(country, \"country.name\", \"region\"),\n    year = date,\n    value\n  )\n\nperc_edu\n\n# A tibble: 217 × 4\n   country             region                      year value\n   &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;                      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Afghanistan         South Asia                  2020 NA   \n 2 Albania             Europe & Central Asia       2020  3.34\n 3 Algeria             Middle East & North Africa  2020  6.19\n 4 American Samoa      East Asia & Pacific         2020 NA   \n 5 Andorra             Europe & Central Asia       2020  2.63\n 6 Angola              Sub-Saharan Africa          2020  2.67\n 7 Antigua and Barbuda Latin America & Caribbean   2020  2.99\n 8 Argentina           Latin America & Caribbean   2020  5.28\n 9 Armenia             Europe & Central Asia       2020  2.71\n10 Aruba               Latin America & Caribbean   2020 NA   \n# ℹ 207 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI have added each country’s region (using countrycode::countrycode()) so that we can also explore regional trends in our data.\n\n\nWe can get a good sense of how expenditure varied by country by looking at the center, spread, and shape of the distribution.\nVisualizing continuous distributions\nFirst, let’s plot each country’s spending to see how they relate to one another. There are two plot types commonly used for this: histograms and density curves.\nHistograms\nA histogram creates buckets along the range of values our variable can take (i.e. buckets of 10 between 1 and 100 would include 1 - 10, 11 - 20, 21 - 30, etc.). It then counts the number of observations that fall into each of those buckets and plots that count.\nLet’s plot our data as a histogram with a bin width of 1 percentage point:\n\nggplot(perc_edu, aes(x = value)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Expenditure on education as a proportion of GDP\",\n    y = \"Number of countries\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this we learn that most countries spend between three to five percent of their GDP on education. There appears to be some outliers. Some countries spend over 10 percent of their GDP on education. This is well above the proportion all other countries spent.\nIf we pick a narrower bin width, we will see more fine-grained detail about the distribution of our data:\n\nggplot(perc_edu, aes(x = value)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Expenditure on education as a proportion of GDP\",\n    y = \"Number of countries\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this we learn that most countries spent around four percent of their GDP on education. There is a small cluster of countries that spent between around 7.5 to nine percent on these services. Three countries spent an unusually large proportion of their GDP (over 10 percent of it) on education annually.\nDensity curves\nDensity curves also communicate the distribution of continuous variables. They plot the density of the data that fall at a given value on the x-axis.\nLet’s plot our data using a density plot:\n\nggplot(perc_edu, aes(x = value)) + \n  geom_density() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Expenditure on education as a proportion of GDP\",\n    y = \"Density\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis provides us with the same information above, but highlights the broader shape of our distribution. We again learn that most countries spend around four percent of their GDP on education. There are some that spend above 7.5 percent.\nUnderstanding distributions\nWe can use the shape of a variable’s distribution to usefully summarize it or to more easily compare it to other variables. Is the distribution symmetric or skewed? Where are the majority of observations clustered? Are there multiple distinct clusters, or high points, in the distribution?\nThere are three broad distributions that you should know: Normal, right-skewed, and left-skewed. People use these terms to summarize the shape of their continuous data.\nNormal distribution\nA Normally distributed variable includes values that fall symmetrically away from their center point, which is the peak (or most common value). Examples of Normally distributed data include the height or weight of all individuals in a large population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis distribution is also referred to as a bell-curve.\n\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_density(aes(x = rnorm(n = 1e6))) + \n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight-skewed distribution\nWith right-skewed data, the majority of data have small values with a small number of larger values. Examples of right-skewed data include countries’ GDP.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_density(aes(x = rbeta(1e6, 2, 10))) + \n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft-skewed distribution\nWith left-skewed data, the majority of data have large values with a small number of small values. Examples of left-skewed data include democracies’ election turn-out rates.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_density(aes(x = rbeta(1e6, 10, 2))) + \n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasures of central tendency: mean, median, and mode\nWe can also use measures of central tendency to quickly describe and compare our variables.\nMean\nThe mean is the average of all values. Formally:\n\\[\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\Sigma x_i}{n}\n\\]\nIn other words, add all of your values together and then divide that total by the number of values you have. We can use R to quickly calculate the mean percent of GDP spent on education by countries in 2020:\n\nmean(perc_edu$value, na.rm = T)\n\n[1] 4.509317\n\n\nOn average, countries spent 4.51% of their GDP on education in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you do not use the argument na.rm (read “NA remove!”), you will get an NA if any exist in your vector of values. This is a good default! You should be very aware of missing data points.\n\n\nMedian\nThe median is the mid-point of all values. To calculate it, put all of your values in order from smallest to largest. Identify the value in the middle. That’s your median.\nIn R:\n\nmedian(perc_edu$value, na.rm = T)\n\n[1] 4.446204\n\n\nThe median country spent 4.45% of their GDP on education in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you have an even number of observations, the median is the half-way-point between the two middle numbers of your ordered values (or the mean of those two middle values). For example, the median of all values from one to 10 is 5.5.\n\n\nMode\nThe mode is the most frequent of all values. To calculate it, count how many times each value occurs in your data set. The one that occurs the most is your mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is usually a more useful summary statistic for categorical variables than continuous ones. For example, which colour of car is most popular? Which political party has the most members?\n\n\nWe can find the modal region in our data set using base R’s table():\n\ntable(perc_edu$region)\n\n\n       East Asia & Pacific      Europe & Central Asia \n                        37                         58 \n Latin America & Caribbean Middle East & North Africa \n                        42                         21 \n             North America                 South Asia \n                         3                          8 \n        Sub-Saharan Africa \n                        48 \n\n\nThe modal (or most common) region in our data set is Europe & Central Asia.\nUsing central tendency to describe and understand distributions\nNormally distributed values have the same mean and median.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor right skewed data, the mean is greater than the median.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor left skewed data, the mean is smaller than the median.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen do we care about the mean or the median? There is no simple answer to this question. Both of these values are useful summaries of our continuous data. We tend to use the average to describe our data in statistical analysis. As you will learn, most regression models are, fundamentally, just fancy averages of our data. However, this approach is not always sensible.\nAs you may have noted above, the average value is more sensitive to extreme values. If you have one very large or very small number in your vector of numbers, your average will be pulled well away from your mid-point (or median). This can lead you astray. To illustrate, let’s look at the average and median of the numbers between one and 10:\n\nx &lt;- 1:10\nx\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\n\nmean(x)\n\n[1] 5.5\n\nmedian(x)\n\n[1] 5.5\n\n\nIf we add one very large number to our vector, our average will shoot up but our median will only move up one additional number in our collection:\n\nx &lt;- c(x, 1000)\nx\n\n [1]    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10 1000\n\n\n\nmean(x)\n\n[1] 95.90909\n\nmedian(x)\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nWhich number better summarizes our data? Here, I would suggest that the average is misleading. That one 1,000 data point is doing a lot of the work. The median better describes the majority of my data.\nWe will talk more about this (and outliers more specifically) later in the course.\nFive number summary\nAs you can see, we are attempting to summarize our continuous data to give us a meaningful but manageable sense of it. Means and medians are useful for this.\nWe can provide more context to our understanding using more summary statistics. A common approach is the five number summary. This includes:\n\nThe smallest value;\nThe 25th percentile value, or the median of the lower half of the data;\nThe median;\nThe 75th percentile value, or the median of the upper half of the data;\nThe largest value.\n\nWe can use skimr::skim() to quickly get useful information about our continuous variable.\n\nskim(perc_edu$value)\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nperc_edu$value\n\n\nNumber of rows\n217\n\n\nNumber of columns\n1\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\nnumeric\n1\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\ndata\n52\n0.76\n4.51\n1.75\n0.36\n3.3\n4.45\n5.53\n10.54\n▂▇▇▂▁\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can use base R’s summary():\n\nsummary(perc_edu$value)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n 0.3596  3.2950  4.4462  4.5093  5.5270 10.5390      52 \n\n\nWe have 217 rows (because our unit of observation is a country, we can read this as 217 countries2). We are missing education spending values for 52 of those countries (see n_missing or summary()’s NA's), giving us a complete rate of 76% (see complete_rate).\nThe country that spent the least on education as a percent of its GDP in 2020 was Nigeria, which spent only 0.4% (see p0). The country that spent the most was the Micronesia, Fed. Sts., which spent 10.5% (see p100). The average percent of GDP spent on education in 2020 was 4.5% (see mean) and the median was 4.4% (see p50).\nThis description was a bit unwieldy. As usual, to get a better sense of our data we should visualize it.\nBox plots\nBox plots (sometimes referred to as box and whisker plots) visualize the five number summary (with bonus features) nicely.\n\nggplot(perc_edu, aes(x = value)) + \n  geom_boxplot() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    axis.text.y = element_blank()\n  ) + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP\",\n    y = NULL\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe box in the graph above displays the 25th percentile, the median, and the 75th percentile values. The tails show you all the data up to a range 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR), or the 75th percentile minus the 25th percentile (or the upper edge of the box minus the lower edge of the box). If the smallest or largest values fall below or above (respectively) 1.5 times the IQR, the tail ends at that value. The remaining data points (if they exist) are displayed as dots shooting away from the whiskers of our box and whisker plot.\nOutliers\nNote that some countries’ expenditure are displayed as dots. The box plot above is providing you with a bit more information than the five number summary alone. If the data include values that fall outside of the IQR, they are displayed as dots. These are (very rule of thumb, take with a grain of salt, please rely on your theory and data generation process instead!) candidates for outliers.\nOutliers fall so far away from the majority of the other values that they should be examined closely and perhaps excluded from your analysis. As discussed above, they can distort your mean. They do not, however, tend to distort your median.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe will talk more about how to deal with outliers later in the course.\n\n\nMeasures of spread: range, variance, and standard deviation\nWe now have a good sense of some of the features of our data. Another useful thing to know is the shape of the distribution. Here, measures of spread are useful.\nRange\nThe range is the difference between the largest and smallest value.\n\\[\nrange = max - min\n\\]\nIn R:\n\nmax(perc_edu$value, na.rm = T) - min(perc_edu$value, na.rm = T)\n\n[1] 10.17936\n\n\nThe difference between the country that spends the highest proportion of its GDP on education and that which spends the least is 10.18 percentage points.\nVariance\nThe variance measures how spread out your values are. On average, how far are your observations from the mean?\nThis measure can, at first, be a bit too abstract to get an immediate handle on. Let’s walk through it. Imagine we have two data sets, wide_dist and narrow_dist. Both are Normally distributed, share the same mean (0), and the same number of observations (1,000,000).\n\nwide_dist\n\n# A tibble: 1,000,000 × 1\n        x\n    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 -1.01 \n 2 -0.887\n 3 -1.36 \n 4 -1.93 \n 5  1.64 \n 6  0.499\n 7  1.24 \n 8 -1.10 \n 9  0.832\n10  0.447\n# ℹ 999,990 more rows\n\n\n\nnarrow_dist\n\n# A tibble: 1,000,000 × 1\n        x\n    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  0.757\n 2  0.864\n 3  1.39 \n 4  2.21 \n 5  0.293\n 6 -1.73 \n 7 -2.42 \n 8  0.343\n 9 -0.488\n10  3.06 \n# ℹ 999,990 more rows\n\n\nLet’s plot them:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite both having the same center point and number of observations, the data are much more spread out around that center point in the top graph (of wide_dist).\nThe data in the top graph have higher variance (are more spread out) than those in the bottom graph. We measure this by calculating the average of the squares of the deviations of the observations from their mean.\n\\[\ns^2 = \\frac{\\Sigma(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n - 1}\n\\]\nLet’s step through this. We will first calculate the variance of wide_dist. To do this:\n\nCalculate the mean of your values.\nCalculate the difference between each individual value and that mean (how far from the mean is every value?).\nSquare those differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe do not care whether the value is higher or lower than the mean. We only care how far from the mean it is. Squaring a value removes its sign (positive or negative). Remember, if you multiply a negative number by a negative number, you get a positive number. This allows us to concentrate on the difference between each individual data point and the mean.\n\n\n\nAdd all of those squared differences to get a single number.\nDivide that single number by the number of observations you have minus 1.\n\nYou now have your variance!\nIn R:\n\nwide_dist_mean &lt;- mean(wide_dist$x)\n\nwide_var_calc &lt;- wide_dist |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    # Calculate the mean\n    mean = wide_dist_mean,\n    # Calculate the difference between each value and the mean\n    diff = x - mean,\n    # Square that difference\n    diff_2 = diff^2\n  )\n\nwide_var_calc\n\n# A tibble: 1,000,000 × 4\n        x       mean   diff diff_2\n    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 -1.01  -0.0000204 -1.01   1.02 \n 2 -0.887 -0.0000204 -0.887  0.787\n 3 -1.36  -0.0000204 -1.36   1.86 \n 4 -1.93  -0.0000204 -1.93   3.73 \n 5  1.64  -0.0000204  1.64   2.70 \n 6  0.499 -0.0000204  0.499  0.249\n 7  1.24  -0.0000204  1.24   1.55 \n 8 -1.10  -0.0000204 -1.10   1.22 \n 9  0.832 -0.0000204  0.832  0.693\n10  0.447 -0.0000204  0.447  0.200\n# ℹ 999,990 more rows\n\n\nWe the add those squared differences between each observation and the mean of our whole sample together. Finally, we divide that by one less than our number of observations.\n\nwide_var &lt;- sum(wide_var_calc$diff_2) / (nrow(wide_var_calc) - 1)\n\nwide_var\n\n[1] 3.998437\n\n\nWe can compare this to the variance for our narrower distribution.\n\nnarrow_var_calc &lt;- narrow_dist |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    mean = mean(narrow_dist$x),\n    diff = x - mean,\n    diff_2 = diff^2\n  )\n\nnarrow_var &lt;- sum(narrow_var_calc$diff_2) / (nrow(narrow_var_calc) - 1)\n\nnarrow_var\n\n[1] 0.9999169\n\n\nIt is, in fact, smaller!\nThat was painful. Happily we can use base R’s var() to do this in one step:\n\nvar(wide_dist)\n\n         x\nx 3.998437\n\n\n\nvar(narrow_dist)\n\n          x\nx 0.9999169\n\n\n\nvar(wide_dist) &gt; var(narrow_dist)\n\n     x\nx TRUE\n\n\nOn average, countries spent 3.06% more or less than the average of 4.51% of their GDP on education in 2020.\nStandard deviation\nA simpler measure of spread is the standard deviation. It is simply the square root of the variance.\n\nsqrt(wide_var)\n\n[1] 1.999609\n\n\n\nsqrt(narrow_var)\n\n[1] 0.9999584\n\n\nYou can get this directly using base R’s sd():\n\nsd(wide_dist$x)\n\n[1] 1.999609\n\n\n\nsd(narrow_dist$x)\n\n[1] 0.9999584\n\n\nThe standard deviation of all countries’ percentage of their GDP that they spent on education in 2020 was 1.75%. This horrible sentence demonstrates that standard deviations are most usefully employed in contexts other than attempts to better describe your variables of interest. For example, they are very important for determining how certain we can be about the relationships between different variables we uncover using statistical models (which we will get to later in the course).",

I use their data in nearly all of my research. Sadly, they tend to provide their data in a messy format. We will now collect that messy data so we can learn how to tidy it up.\nTo access their data and some wonderful data visualizations, you can head over to their data portal: https://data.worldbank.org/. From there, you can browse which data sets they have or search for ones you are interested in.\nWe are going to start by collecting data on countries’ GDP per capita (current US$). It can be accessed here: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD. You can download the data directly from this web page, save it in the appropriate place in your RProject, and read it in from there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis process is similar to the one we used in Session 2: From Samples to the Population.\n\n\nI saved the CSV in the data folder (which is the in the content folder because this is a website), so I will use here::here() to adaptively find the correct file path and read the file in using read_csv().\n\ngdp_per_cap_raw &lt;- read_csv(here::here(\"content\", \"data\", \n                                       \"API_NY.GDP.PCAP.CD_DS2_en_csv_v2_76.csv\"))\n\nAfter running this yourself, you will see an ominous warning.

We have now read in the data set itself, skipping those rows of metadata.\nThe resulting data set is a wide one. Each observation is a country or region. The first two columns provide information on the country. The third and fourth describe the indicator. All other columns provide each country’s GDP per capita in all years from 1960 to 2023.\nNow, imagine you want to compare a country’s GDP per capita across many years. For example, you want to know how Australians’ wealth has grown over time. This is very difficult to do with this current format. We would need to work with all columns from 1960 to 2023!\nTo make these data easier to work with, we will lengthen the data set. Instead of each observation (row) describing a country, we will make each observation describe a country-year.\nTo do this, we need to use pivot_longer(). We need to let it know which columns we want to transpose using the col argument. Because the end year for these data will change each year I want to pull and clean up this data set (for example, next year the last column will be 2024, not 2023), I will use ! to negate the columns I don’t want to transpose. This code will, therefore, work after each annual update to the data set.\n\ngdp_per_cap &lt;- gdp_per_cap_raw |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = !c(`Country Name`:`Indicator Code`),\n               names_to = \"year\",\n               values_to = \"gdp_per_cap\")\n\ngdp_per_cap\n\n# A tibble: 17,290 × 6\n   `Country Name` `Country Code` `Indicator Name`         `Indicator Code` year \n   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                    &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;\n 1 Aruba          ABW            GDP per capita (current… NY.GDP.PCAP.CD   1960 \n 2 Aruba          ABW            GDP per capita (current… NY.GDP.PCAP.CD   1961 \n 3 Aruba          ABW            GDP per capita (current… NY.GDP.PCAP.CD   1962 \n 4 Aruba          ABW            GDP per capita (current… NY.GDP.PCAP.CD   1963 \n 5 Aruba          ABW            GDP per capita (current… NY.GDP.PCAP.CD   1964 \n 6 Aruba          ABW            GDP per capita (current… NY.GDP.PCAP.CD   1965 \n 7 Aruba          ABW            GDP per capita (current… NY.GDP.PCAP.CD   1966 \n 8 Aruba          ABW            GDP per capita (current… NY.GDP.PCAP.CD   1967 \n 9 Aruba          ABW            GDP per capita (current… NY.GDP.PCAP.CD   1968 \n10 Aruba          ABW            GDP per capita (current… NY.GDP.PCAP.CD   1969 \n# ℹ 17,280 more rows\n# ℹ 1 more variable: gdp_per_cap &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nI have also told pivot_longer() what to call the column containing the previous column names (using names_to) and the column containing the values (using values_to).\nYou might have noticed that I needed to include some back ticks when referencing those column names.

    "text": "Widening messy data\nSometimes you want to widen your data. tidyr provides a similar function, pivot_wider(), to do just this. Let’s start by getting some long data. We will again collect these data from the World Bank, but this time we will use wbstats to access it directly through the API.\nWe will add to our data set information on each country’s average life expectancy (ID: SP.DYN.LE00.IN).\n\ngapminder_raw &lt;- wb_data(\n  indicator = c(\"SP.DYN.LE00.IN\", \"NY.GDP.PCAP.CD\"),\n  return_wide = F\n)\n\ngapminder_raw\n\n# A tibble: 27,776 × 11\n   indicator_id   indicator     iso2c iso3c country  date value unit  obs_status\n   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     \n 1 SP.DYN.LE00.IN Life expecta… AF    AFG   Afghan…  2023  NA   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;      \n 2 SP.DYN.LE00.IN Life expecta… AF    AFG   Afghan…  2022  62.9 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;      \n 3 SP.DYN.LE00.IN Life expecta… AF    AFG   Afghan…  2021  62.0 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;      \n 4 SP.DYN.LE00.IN Life expecta… AF    AFG   Afghan…  2020  62.6 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;      \n 5 SP.DYN.LE00.IN Life expecta… AF    AFG   Afghan…  2019  63.6 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;      \n 6 SP.DYN.LE00.IN Life expecta… AF    AFG   Afghan…  2018  63.1 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;      \n 7 SP.DYN.LE00.IN Life expecta… AF    AFG   Afghan…  2017  63.0 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;      \n 8 SP.DYN.LE00.IN Life expecta… AF    AFG   Afghan…  2016  63.1 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;      \n 9 SP.DYN.LE00.IN Life expecta… AF    AFG   Afghan…  2015  62.7 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;      \n10 SP.DYN.LE00.IN Life expecta… AF    AFG   Afghan…  2014  62.5 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;      \n# ℹ 27,766 more rows\n# ℹ 2 more variables: footnote &lt;chr&gt;, last_updated &lt;date&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBy default, the wonderful wb_data() function will return data to you in a clean (and wide) format. Therefore, to illustrate how to wrangle these data, I need to include the return_wide = F argument.\n\n\nWe now have data on each country-year-indicator. For example, let’s look at what we have for Afghanistan in 2018:\n\ngapminder_raw |&gt; \n  filter(country == \"Afghanistan\", date == 2018)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 11\n  indicator_id   indicator      iso2c iso3c country  date value unit  obs_status\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     \n1 SP.DYN.LE00.IN Life expectan… AF    AFG   Afghan…  2018  63.1 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;      \n2 NY.GDP.PCAP.CD GDP per capit… AF    AFG   Afghan…  2018 491.  &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;      \n# ℹ 2 more variables: footnote &lt;chr&gt;, last_updated &lt;date&gt;\n\n\nThis is difficult to work with. For example, think about how you would plot each country’s GDP per capita against its average life expectancy for a single year.\nWe need to make these data wider. We want our observations to be country-year. We will therefore have a column for each country-year’s GDP per capita and its average life expectancy.\npivot_wider() works by creating a new column for each unique value in the column you tell it to draws names from (using the names_from argument). It will then populate that column with the corresponding value from the column you tell it to draw values from (using the values_from argument). It preserves all unique values in the other rows.\nThis is a little easier to understand in practice. Let’s step through widening our Gapminder data. I’ll start by diving straight in:\n\npivot_wider(gapminder_raw, names_from = indicator_id, values_from = value)\n\n# A tibble: 27,776 × 11\n   indicator    iso2c iso3c country  date unit  obs_status footnote last_updated\n   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;date&gt;      \n 1 Life expect… AF    AFG   Afghan…  2023 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;     2024-12-16  \n 2 Life expect… AF    AFG   Afghan…  2022 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;     2024-12-16  \n 3 Life expect… AF    AFG   Afghan…  2021 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;     2024-12-16  \n 4 Life expect… AF    AFG   Afghan…  2020 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;     2024-12-16  \n 5 Life expect… AF    AFG   Afghan…  2019 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;     2024-12-16  \n 6 Life expect… AF    AFG   Afghan…  2018 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;     2024-12-16  \n 7 Life expect… AF    AFG   Afghan…  2017 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;     2024-12-16  \n 8 Life expect… AF    AFG   Afghan…  2016 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;     2024-12-16  \n 9 Life expect… AF    AFG   Afghan…  2015 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;     2024-12-16  \n10 Life expect… AF    AFG   Afghan…  2014 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;     2024-12-16  \n# ℹ 27,766 more rows\n# ℹ 2 more variables: SP.DYN.LE00.IN &lt;dbl&gt;, NY.GDP.PCAP.CD &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nWe now have two new columns: SP.DYN.LE00.IN for average life expectancy, and NY.GDP.PCAP.CD for GDP per capita. These columns contain the corresponding values for each country-year’s average life expectancy and GDP per capita.\nHowever, something has gone wrong. Our wider data set should have fewer rows than our longer one. This is because we are hoping to have one row for each country-year containing information on its average life expectancy and GDP per capita for each year, rather than two rows for each country-year (one for each indicator). Why is this happening?\nWell, the World Bank data set includes unique information about each indicator in the indicator column. Because this is country-year-indicator level information, pivot_wider() - in an attempt to preserve that information - creates a country-year-indicator level data set. To tidy and widen our data set, we need to remove all country-year-indicator level information and then pivot it.\n\ngapminder &lt;- gapminder_raw |&gt;\n  select(!indicator) |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(names_from = indicator_id, values_from = value)\ngapminder\n\n# A tibble: 13,897 × 10\n   iso2c iso3c country      date unit  obs_status footnote last_updated\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;date&gt;      \n 1 AF    AFG   Afghanistan  2023 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;     2024-12-16  \n 2 AF    AFG   Afghanistan  2022 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;     2024-12-16  \n 3 AF    AFG   Afghanistan  2021 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;     2024-12-16  \n 4 AF    AFG   Afghanistan  2020 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;     2024-12-16  \n 5 AF    AFG   Afghanistan  2019 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;     2024-12-16  \n 6 AF    AFG   Afghanistan  2018 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;     2024-12-16  \n 7 AF    AFG   Afghanistan  2017 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;     2024-12-16  \n 8 AF    AFG   Afghanistan  2016 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;     2024-12-16  \n 9 AF    AFG   Afghanistan  2015 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;     2024-12-16  \n10 AF    AFG   Afghanistan  2014 &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;     2024-12-16  \n# ℹ 13,887 more rows\n# ℹ 2 more variables: SP.DYN.LE00.IN &lt;dbl&gt;, NY.GDP.PCAP.CD &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nMuch better!

    "text": "Representative samples\nSurveys are conducted on a subset of a our population of interest. This is because it is often unfeasible (or impossible) to ask these questions of our population.\nTo be able to infer from our sample information about our population, we need to ensure the sample is representative of that population. In other words, we need to try our best to make sure the sample looks very similar to our population.\nRemember back to the last session on experiments. In an ideal world, we would be able to create two parallel worlds (one with the treatment, one held as our control). These two worlds would be identical to each other prior to treatment. This allows us to confidently state that any differences in our outcome of interest were caused by the treatment. It was, after all, the only thing differentiating those two worlds.\nSadly, however, we have no time machine and cannot produce two parallel worlds. Instead, we needed to create two groups that are as identical to one another as possible prior to treatment. If they are (almost) identical, differences between their group-wide outcomes can be attributed to the treatment.\nOne very good way of getting two (almost) identical groups is to assign individuals to those groups randomly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor more on why randomization works, please head back to Randomization in Causes and Effects.\n\n\nSimilarly, we can use randomization to pull a sample from our population that looks, on average, identical to that population. Drawing randomly from our population increases our chances of ending up with a sample that reflects that population."

If this holds, you have a pure random sample.\nHowever, this is really hard to do! For example, think about how likely you are to answer a call from an unknown number. Pollsters rely on people picking up their calls. Imagine you do answer: how likely are you to sit through an interview with a pollster?\nThere are groups of people in the US voting population who are more likely to pick up a call from an unknown number. For example, people with land line phones are much more likely to answer that call (they cannot see it is from an unknown number). Similarly, there are groups of people who are more likely to sit through an interview with a pollster. For example, retired people who have the time to spare during their day. These people are systematically different from the population as a whole. People with land land phones tend to be older, on average, than the general population. Similarly, retired people tend to be older than the general population.\nThis is important because older people tend to be more conservative than the general population as well. Your survey (which will include a disproportionately large group of older people) is likely to overstate how conservative the population as a whole is."

Consider trying to answer the question: what was the average GDP earned by countries globally in 2022?\nTo demonstrate the effects of a biased sample, we are going to download all available GDP values for 2022 using the World Bank’s application programming interface (API). We are going to use the wb_data() function from the wbstats R package to do this. I am going to assign the resulting data set to an object called gdp_df.\n\ngdp_df &lt;- wb_data(\"NY.GDP.MKTP.CD\", return_wide = F, start_date = 2022, end_date = 2022) |&gt; \n  # Select only the relevant data points\n  select(iso3c:value)\n\ngdp_df\n\n# A tibble: 217 × 4\n   iso3c country              date         value\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 AFG   Afghanistan          2022  14497243872.\n 2 ALB   Albania              2022  19017242586.\n 3 DZA   Algeria              2022 225638456572.\n 4 ASM   American Samoa       2022    871000000 \n 5 AND   Andorra              2022   3380612573.\n 6 AGO   Angola               2022 104399746853.\n 7 ATG   Antigua and Barbuda  2022   1867733333.\n 8 ARG   Argentina            2022 632790070063.\n 9 ARM   Armenia              2022  19513506553.\n10 ABW   Aruba                2022   3279343544.\n# ℹ 207 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRun ?wb_data in your console to see what arguments the function takes.\n\n\nWe are going to treat this data set as complete. In other words, we will assume that this data set includes the actual GDP values for all countries globally in 2022. This is cheeky for many reasons. Most obviously, we are missing a whole bunch of data points.

I am, therefore, going to update the gdp_df object to exclude those missing values:\n\ngdp_df &lt;- drop_na(gdp_df, value)\n\nNow, imagine I - the researcher who wants to work out the average GDP earned by countries globally in 2022 - do not have access to these data. I need to go out and collect them myself. To do this, I intend to send a request for information to every country’s Department of Statistics, asking them for their country’s GDP in 2022. Annoyingly, however, I can only find contact details for some departments. Specifically, I can only find details for departments with very flashy websites that provide a lot of detail on how to contact teams of people whose whole job is to answer such requests for information.\nLet’s update the gdp_df data set to include which countries I found contact details for. We are going to use some simulation here, which I will explain below.\n\n# Find the GDP value the marks the lowest 25 percent of all GDP values in 2022\nfirst_quartile_gdp &lt;- quantile(gdp_df$value, na.rm = T)[[2]]\n\ngdp_df &lt;- gdp_df |&gt; \n  # Create a variable that simulates my finding the contact details for countries with flashy \n  # websites (i.e. rich countries)\n  rowwise() |&gt; \n  mutate(contact_details_found = if_else(value &lt; first_quartile_gdp, \n                                         rbinom(1, 1, 0.10), \n                                         rbinom(1, 1, 0.75))) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI am doing a fair bit mechanically here that could distract from my broader point about biased sampling. If, starting to read this note, you find yourself getting a bit lost, please just move on. We will come back to these concepts later.\nJumping ahead to the end, richer countries are more likely than poorer ones to have well-funded, large departments of statistics. To simulate this, I first need a definition of rich countries. I took the 25th percentile as my cut off point. The 25th percentile is the value below which 25 percent of all of the values in a series (ordered from smallest to largest) sit. So, the 25th percentile of my 2022 GDP values is the GDP value below which 25 percent of all other GDP values sit.\nRicher countries are more likely to have departments with accessible teams of people able to field my request for information. This does not mean that they definitely do, nor does it mean no poorer countries do. To account for this, I determine randomly whether a country has contact details based on its GDP value. For poorer countries (those in the lowest 25 percent of all countries), I give them a 10 percent chance I find their contact details. For richer countries (those in the highest 75 percent of all countries), I give them a 75 percent chance I find their contact details. I use the rbinom() function to do this. We will talk about this probability distribution function later in the course.\nI have now simulated data that reflects the constraints I would face as a researcher trying to answer my question.\n\n\nUndeterred, I send out my requests to those departments I have contact details for. I receive some responses:\n\ngdp_responses_df &lt;- gdp_df |&gt; \n  # Only sample from the countries I contacted\n  filter(contact_details_found == 1) |&gt; \n  # Simulate the uneven likelihood I receive responses back (based on wealth)\n  mutate(response_received = if_else(value &lt; first_quartile_gdp,\n                                     rbinom(1, 1, 0.5),\n                                     rbinom(1, 1, 0.8))) |&gt;\n  filter(response_received == 1) |&gt; \n  select(iso3c:value)\n\ngdp_responses_df\n\n# A tibble: 116 × 4\n   iso3c country      date   value\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 AFG   Afghanistan  2022 1.45e10\n 2 ALB   Albania      2022 1.90e10\n 3 DZA   Algeria      2022 2.26e11\n 4 AGO   Angola       2022 1.04e11\n 5 ARM   Armenia      2022 1.95e10\n 6 AUS   Australia    2022 1.69e12\n 7 AUT   Austria      2022 4.72e11\n 8 BHR   Bahrain      2022 4.67e10\n 9 BGD   Bangladesh   2022 4.60e11\n10 BEL   Belgium      2022 5.93e11\n# ℹ 106 more rows\n\n\nNow, if I use this sample to learn something about the average GDP in 2022 for all countries globally, I am going to be wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nCan you guess which way I will be wrong? Will I overstate or understate the global average GDP?\n\n\nHere is the average GDP among my sample:\n\ngdp_responses_df |&gt; \n  summarise(avg_gdp = mean(value)) |&gt; \n  pull() |&gt; \n  dollar()\n\n[1] \"$506,556,083,940\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe scales package includes handy functions for formatting numbers. I have used its dollar() function to format the average GDP nicely.\n\n\nAnd here is the average GDP among the population:\n\ngdp_df |&gt; \n  summarise(avg_gdp = mean(value)) |&gt; \n  pull() |&gt; \n  dollar()\n\n[1] \"$487,688,575,556\"\n\n\nI am overstating the average by a lot! Why? Well, countries that have departments of statistics that are so well funded they can splash out for a fancy website and have a team of people dedicated to fielding requests for information from random academics tend to be wealthy. Poorer countries are less able to spare the funds required to meet my request. I am, therefore, less likely to have found a way to contact them and, even if I did, I am less likely to have received a response from them.\nThis is an example of sampling bias: my sample is systematically different from my population in ways important to my analysis. Wealth is what I am trying to measure, and wealth is influencing who gets into my sample and who does not. Because I do not have a representative sample, I cannot infer from that sample anything about my population."

I am going to select completely randomly five countries from the (cheeky) population using dplyr’s sample_n() function:\n\ngdp_5_df &lt;- sample_n(gdp_df, size = 5)\ngdp_5_df\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 5\n  iso3c country              date   value contact_details_found\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;                 &lt;int&gt;\n1 TTO   Trinidad and Tobago  2022 3.01e10                     1\n2 IDN   Indonesia            2022 1.32e12                     1\n3 XKX   Kosovo               2022 9.35e 9                     1\n4 MDV   Maldives             2022 6.18e 9                     0\n5 MCO   Monaco               2022 8.80e 9                     1\n\n\nThe average GDP among this very small but pure random sample is $274,692,433,009, which is $212,996,142,547 dollars away from the population average.\nWe can do this again to see that it wasn’t just a fluke:\n\ngdp_5_df &lt;- sample_n(gdp_df, size = 5)\ngdp_5_df\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 5\n  iso3c country         date        value contact_details_found\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;                 &lt;int&gt;\n1 KIR   Kiribati        2022   270841698.                     0\n2 CUW   Curacao         2022  3075180835.                     0\n3 LCA   St. Lucia       2022  2342703704.                     1\n4 CIV   Cote d'Ivoire   2022 70173140101.                     1\n5 ASM   American Samoa  2022   871000000                      0\n\n\nThe average GDP among this small pure random sample is $15,346,573,268, a $472,342,002,288 dollar difference from the population average.\nIf we increase our sample size, we get closer to the population average:\n\ngdp_175_df &lt;- sample_n(gdp_df, size = 175)\ngdp_175_df\n\n# A tibble: 175 × 5\n   iso3c country                         date   value contact_details_found\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                          &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;                 &lt;int&gt;\n 1 TTO   Trinidad and Tobago             2022 3.01e10                     1\n 2 OMN   Oman                            2022 1.12e11                     0\n 3 KNA   St. Kitts and Nevis             2022 9.81e 8                     0\n 4 PAN   Panama                          2022 7.63e10                     0\n 5 COL   Colombia                        2022 3.45e11                     1\n 6 VCT   St. Vincent and the Grenadines  2022 9.66e 8                     0\n 7 TZA   Tanzania                        2022 7.58e10                     0\n 8 ITA   Italy                           2022 2.10e12                     1\n 9 MHL   Marshall Islands                2022 2.53e 8                     0\n10 GRD   Grenada                         2022 1.22e 9                     0\n# ℹ 165 more rows\n\n\nThe average GDP among this small pure random sample is $546,787,923,128, a mere $59,099,347,572 dollar difference from the population average.\nThe larger your sample size, the closer you will get to the population average. You increase the likelihood you capture the diversity of the population as your sample size increases. This is referred to as sampling variability."

    "text": "US Presidential Elections\nUS Presidential elections involve thousands of surveys of the US population. Pollsters ask a small subset of that population questions about the election (including which candidate they intend to vote for). They hope to learn from the answers provided by that sample the views of the broader population.\nWe will look at surveys run in the 2020 US Presidential Election. We will learn about overall support for the two candidates (Joe Biden and Donald Trump), and how this support shifted across different demographics. We will then compare that survey to the end result to learn how accurately the survey reflected the population’s views.\nA survey of votes cast\nWe are going to look at the American National Election Studies pre-election survey. The ANES conducts surveys on voting, public opinion, and political participation. You can learn more about them from their website.\nTo download the data, you will need to head over to the ANES website, download the relevant file, and save it in your RProject. The following video demonstrates how to do this.\n\n\nOnce you have collected the data, you can read it in using the readr package’s read_csv() function. It takes the file’s path as its first argument.\n\nanes_raw &lt;- read_csv(here(\"content\", \"data\", \"anes_timeseries_2020_csv_20220210.csv\"))\nanes_raw\n\n# A tibble: 8,280 × 1,771\n   version  V200001 V160001_orig V200002 V200003 V200004 V200005 V200006 V200007\n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 ANES202…  200015       401318       3       2       3       0      -2      -2\n 2 ANES202…  200022       300261       3       2       3       0       4      -1\n 3 ANES202…  200039       400181       3       2       3       0      -2      -2\n 4 ANES202…  200046       300171       3       2       3       0      -2      -2\n 5 ANES202…  200053       405145       3       2       3       1      -2      -2\n 6 ANES202…  200060       400374       3       2       3       0      -2      -2\n 7 ANES202…  200084       407013       3       2       3       0      -2      -2\n 8 ANES202…  200091       407174       3       2       3       0      -2      -2\n 9 ANES202…  200107       406264       3       2       3       0      -2      -2\n10 ANES202…  200114       402782       3       2       3       1       4      -1\n# ℹ 8,270 more rows\n# ℹ 1,762 more variables: V200008 &lt;dbl&gt;, V200009 &lt;dbl&gt;, V200010a &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   V200010b &lt;dbl&gt;, V200010c &lt;dbl&gt;, V200010d &lt;dbl&gt;, V200011a &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   V200011b &lt;dbl&gt;, V200011c &lt;dbl&gt;, V200011d &lt;dbl&gt;, V200012a &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   V200012b &lt;dbl&gt;, V200012c &lt;dbl&gt;, V200012d &lt;dbl&gt;, V200013a &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   V200013b &lt;dbl&gt;, V200013c &lt;dbl&gt;, V200013d &lt;dbl&gt;, V200014a &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   V200014b &lt;dbl&gt;, V200014c &lt;dbl&gt;, V200014d &lt;dbl&gt;, V200015a &lt;dbl&gt;, …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe here R package makes saving data in a robust way very easy. Using here::here(), you can automatically update file paths to reflect the computer you are currently using. To demonstrate, run the following code:\n\nhere::here()\n\n[1] \"/Users/harrietgoers/Documents/APAN_maths_camp\"\n\n\nYour output will be different to mine. here::here() locates the top level of the file directory in which you are located. This is helpful when you share your code with others (or switch to a new computer). Hard coded file paths will cause annoying errors.\nI like to save my data in a folder called data. You can use a structure you find works for you.\n\n\nEach row of this data set represents a single respondent. Therefore, we can quickly note that in 2020, the ANES surveyed 8,280 people.\nThe ANES asks a lot of questions of its respondents. Full details of these questions can be found in their survey questionnaire document. We are interested in learning whether the survey respondents reflect the behavior of all US voters in the 2020 US Presidential election. To answer this question, we are going to focus on their response to the question: which Presidential candidate did you vote for?\nThis question was only asked of respondents who had already told the interviewer that they voted for a US president. Not all respondents voted, so we need to remove those who did not from our data set.\nWe will then match these data to the total vote count each candidate won in the election to see if they are similar.\nLet’s start by transforming our data set into one that is more suitable for this analysis:\n\nanes_df &lt;- anes_raw |&gt; \n  select(respondent_id = V200001,\n         voted_for_pres = V202072,\n         pres_vote = V202073)\n\nanes_df\n\n# A tibble: 8,280 × 3\n   respondent_id voted_for_pres pres_vote\n           &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1        200015             -1        -1\n 2        200022              1         3\n 3        200039              1         1\n 4        200046              1         1\n 5        200053              1         2\n 6        200060              1         1\n 7        200084              1         2\n 8        200091             -1        -1\n 9        200107             -1        -1\n10        200114              1         1\n# ℹ 8,270 more rows\n\n\nIndividuals’ responses are coded as numbers, which are easily interpreted by the computer, but not by us humans. Let’s recode the responses so we know what they are. They are categorical variables (which R refers to as factors). Currently, they are coded as numbers (&lt;dbl&gt;). To convert them to factors, we need to use factor() within mutate():\n\nanes_df &lt;- anes_df |&gt; \n  mutate(voted_for_pres = factor(voted_for_pres, levels = 1:2, \n                                 labels = c(\"Yes, voted for President\",\n                                            \"No, didn’t vote for President\")),\n         pres_vote = factor(pres_vote, levels = 1:5,\n                            labels = c(\"DEMOCRAT\",\n                                       \"REPUBLICAN\",\n                                       \"LIBERTARIAN\",\n                                       \"GREENS\",\n                                       \"OTHER\")))\n\nanes_df\n\n# A tibble: 8,280 × 3\n   respondent_id voted_for_pres           pres_vote  \n           &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;                    &lt;fct&gt;      \n 1        200015 &lt;NA&gt;                     &lt;NA&gt;       \n 2        200022 Yes, voted for President LIBERTARIAN\n 3        200039 Yes, voted for President DEMOCRAT   \n 4        200046 Yes, voted for President DEMOCRAT   \n 5        200053 Yes, voted for President REPUBLICAN \n 6        200060 Yes, voted for President DEMOCRAT   \n 7        200084 Yes, voted for President REPUBLICAN \n 8        200091 &lt;NA&gt;                     &lt;NA&gt;       \n 9        200107 &lt;NA&gt;                     &lt;NA&gt;       \n10        200114 Yes, voted for President DEMOCRAT   \n# ℹ 8,270 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI got the response labels from the survey questionnaire linked above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nfactor() takes as its first argument the name of the column you would like to convert to a factor. You then specify which numbers you need to code as your values using the levels argument. Finally, you supply the more human-friendly name of those values in the labels argument.\n\n\nI now have a much cleaner version of my data set. Next, we need to exclude those respondents who did not vote for any Presidential candidate or who did not respond to the interviewer’s question about which candidate they voted for:\n\npres_voted_df &lt;- anes_df |&gt; \n  filter(voted_for_pres == \"Yes, voted for President\") |&gt; \n  drop_na(pres_vote)\n\npres_voted_df\n\n# A tibble: 5,877 × 3\n   respondent_id voted_for_pres           pres_vote  \n           &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;                    &lt;fct&gt;      \n 1        200022 Yes, voted for President LIBERTARIAN\n 2        200039 Yes, voted for President DEMOCRAT   \n 3        200046 Yes, voted for President DEMOCRAT   \n 4        200053 Yes, voted for President REPUBLICAN \n 5        200060 Yes, voted for President DEMOCRAT   \n 6        200084 Yes, voted for President REPUBLICAN \n 7        200114 Yes, voted for President DEMOCRAT   \n 8        200121 Yes, voted for President DEMOCRAT   \n 9        200138 Yes, voted for President DEMOCRAT   \n10        200152 Yes, voted for President REPUBLICAN \n# ℹ 5,867 more rows\n\n\nWe now have data on 5,877 individuals who voted for a Presidential candidate and provided their vote to the interviewer. Let’s take a look at the total number of votes each candidate received:\n\npres_voted_df |&gt; \n  count(pres_vote) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = reorder(pres_vote, n))) + \n  geom_col() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Votes received\",\n       y = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoe Biden (the Democratic candidate) received the most votes among the ANES survey respondents. Let’s represent this as vote proportions so we can more easily compare it to the votes received by each candidate nationally:\n\npres_voted_df |&gt; \n  count(pres_vote) |&gt; \n  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = prop, y = reorder(pres_vote, prop))) + \n  geom_col() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Precentage of total votes\",\n       y = NULL) + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe population of votes cast\nSo, were they right? To answer this question, we need to get data on the total number of votes each Presidential candidate received in 2020. The MIT Election Data + Science Lab provides these returns to the public. To access their data, we will use the Harvard Dataverse API. We will access it using the R package dataverse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe dataverse package accesses the Harvard Dataverse Application Programming Interface (API) in the background. To learn more about how to access this API directly, check out the Harvard Dataverse documentation.\n\n\nWe will be accessing the U.S. President 1976–2020 data set. To do this, we need three pieces of information:\n\nThe name of the file we want to download\nThe data set’s DOI\nThe data set’s format\n\nWe can get all of this information from the data set’s page on the Harvard Dataverse website.\n\npres_results_df &lt;- get_dataframe_by_name(\n  filename = \"1976-2020-president.tab\",\n  dataset = \"10.7910/DVN/42MVDX\",\n  server = \"dataverse.harvard.edu\",\n  original = T,\n  .f = readr::read_csv\n)\n\nThis code programmatically pulls the most up-to-date data set from the API. Once the MIT Election Lab publishes the 2024 Presidential Election data, you will only need to update the file name to be able to access it.\nWe are interested in looking at the 2020 Presidential Election, so we will transform our data to exclude all others. Also, these data are at the state-level. We need to aggregate them up to the national level.\nWe do both of these things in the following code chunk:\n\npres_results_2020_df &lt;- pres_results_df |&gt; \n  filter(year == 2020) |&gt; \n  group_by(party_simplified) |&gt; \n  summarise(candidatevotes = sum(candidatevotes)) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\npres_results_2020_df\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  party_simplified candidatevotes\n  &lt;chr&gt;                     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 DEMOCRAT               81268908\n2 LIBERTARIAN             1797355\n3 OTHER                   1246094\n4 REPUBLICAN             74216146\n\n\nFinally, we will calculate the proportion of votes each candidate received to make it comparable to the survey results:\n\npres_results_national_df &lt;- pres_results_2020_df |&gt; \n  mutate(prop_pop = candidatevotes / sum(candidatevotes))\n\nggplot(pres_results_national_df, aes(x = prop_pop, y = reorder(party_simplified, prop_pop))) + \n  geom_col() +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Percentage of total votes\",\n       y = NULL) + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MIT Election Lab folds the Greens party into the “other” category, whereas the ANES separates them out. To make these comparable, we need to fold the Greens votes into the “other” category. We can do this using the forcats package’s (loaded in with the tidyverse) fct_recode() function:\n\nanes_df &lt;- mutate(anes_df, pres_vote = fct_recode(pres_vote, OTHER = \"GREENS\"))\n\nanes_national_results &lt;- anes_df |&gt; \n  filter(voted_for_pres == \"Yes, voted for President\" & !is.na(pres_vote)) |&gt; \n  count(pres_vote) |&gt; \n  transmute(party_simplified = pres_vote, prop_survey = n / sum(n))\n\nNow we can compare these two:\n\npres_results_national_df |&gt; \n  left_join(anes_national_results, by = join_by(party_simplified)) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(prop_pop:prop_survey) |&gt; \n  mutate(name = case_when(name == \"prop_pop\" ~ \"Population\",\n                          name == \"prop_survey\" ~ \"Survey\")) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = reorder(party_simplified, value), fill = name)) + \n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Percentage of total votes\",\n       y = NULL, \n       fill = NULL) + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like the ANES did a fairly good job of capturing the US voting population’s behavior. The proportion of survey respondents who said they voted for each candidate (represented by the blue bar) is roughly equal to the proportion of votes won by each candidate (represented by the pink bar).\nOne interesting thing to note is that the survey did overstate support for Joe Biden and understated support for Donald Trump. We might see this despite having a representative sample. For example, people - when asked who they voted for - may be inclined to say they voted for the winner (regardless of who that winner was). Also, individuals may be hesitant to tell a pollster that they voted for Donald Trump given how divisive he and his campaign were.\nIt is; however, very likely that the ANES did not reach a representative sample of the US voting population. As we discussed above: this is very difficult (if not impossible) to do. ANES runs very good surveys precisely because they acknowledge and, to the best of their ability, account for this. Generally, surveys will compare the demographics of their respondents to those of the voting population (or population more generally). If they find that some individuals are under-represented in their sample (for example, young black women make up a smaller proportion of their sample than they make up in the population), they will make the responses of individuals who fit those demographics count for more than one response in their calculations. Similarly, if they find a demographic is over-represented in their sample, they will make their responses count for less than one response in their calculations. This practice is called weighting and it is standard across all major and respected surveys."

We will explore the linear relationship between two variables focusing not only on the direction and strength of that relationship, but also how certain we can be in that the relationship. At the end of this session you will be able to describe how those two variables relate to one another, and whether that relationship is statistically significant.\nAs usual, we will build our understanding using an example. As an Australian (more specifically, a Victorian), I love the Australian Football League. It’s the best sport out there! We’re going to depart from our usual political science examples to explore some interesting relationships in the way AFL is played.\nFirst, let’s watch this brief introduction to the game:\n\nLet’s explore the relationship between disposal efficiency and Dream Team points. Your disposal efficiency describes the percentage of your disposals of the ball (kicks, handballs, etc.) that lead to a positive outcome for your team. The Dream Team is a popular fantasy football competition. Each player gets points for various actions they take on the field. For example, you get six Dream Team points for scoring a goal and you lose three points for having a free kick awarded against you. This is a useful proxy measure of a player’s effectiveness on the field."

    "text": "Uncovering the relationship between two variables\nFirst, we want to determine the direction of the relationship between our variables of interest. When a player’s disposal efficiency increases, do they tend to get a greater or fewer number of Dream Team points?\nWe can often identify the direction of the relationship by plotting our data:\n\nggplot(afl_df, aes(x = disposalEfficiency, y = dreamTeamPoints)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship looks positive: as your efficiency increases, so too do your Dream Team points. This makes sense. A good player is more effective (tends to produce good results from their kicks and handballs). Our Dream Team points are a proxy for an effective player. However, there is a fair bit of noise here. This relationship doesn’t look very strong.\nNext, we want to formalize that relationship. We want to find the line that best fits all of these points. In other words, what line minimizes the distance between itself and all of the observed points marking each player’s Dream Team points and disposal efficiency?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRemember, this is the basis for Ordinary Least Squares regression.\n\n\nWe can use ggplot2::geom_smooth() to fit this line graphically:\n\nggplot(afl_df, aes(x = disposalEfficiency, y = dreamTeamPoints)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = F) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe correctly identified that there is a positive relationship between those two variables. Yay!\nOften we need more information than simply the direction of a relationship. For example, we want to know how pronounced the effect of a one-unit increase in our independent variable will be on our outcome of interest. Here, we want to learn how many additional Dream Team points are associated with a a one percentage point increase in a player’s disposal efficiency, on average.\nWe can use lm() to determine this information:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRemember to put your dependent variable first, then a ~, then you independent variable(s).\n\n\n\nm &lt;- lm(dreamTeamPoints ~ disposalEfficiency, data = afl_df)\nsummary(m)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = dreamTeamPoints ~ disposalEfficiency, data = afl_df)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-51.16 -18.77  -4.29  14.42 115.49 \n\nCoefficients:\n                   Estimate Std.

We now have a linear regression model of the relationship between a player’s disposal efficiency and their Dream Team points.\nWe predict that players that have a disposal efficiency of zero (none of their disposals result in a good outcome for their team) have, on average, 43.5 Dream Team points. Every one percentage point increase in a player’s efficiency is associated with a gain of 0.116 Dream Team points, on average.\nGreat! We can use this information to understand this relationship more meaningfully. For example, we note that a player with a disposal efficiency of 1.16 percentage points greater than another player has, on average, 10 more Dream Team points than the other player."

    "text": "Uncertainty around this relationship\nHow confident can we be in this modeled relationship? Am I really sure that efficiency has a significant, positive impact on a player’s Dream Team points? I mean, that line looks pretty flat. Could this really just be driven by noise? To answer these questions, we need to draw on everything we have learned about probability theory and inference so far.\nWe want to make a claim about the relationship between some outcome and some variables that we think are important determinants of that outcome. Here, we used the observed Dream Team points gained by a player and their disposal efficiency for round 10 in the 2024 season of AFLW to make a broader statement about the relationship between efficiency and Dream Team points. We are not actually interested in the specific relationship between these variables in round 10 of the 2024 season: we want to know whether a player’s efficiency is an important determinant of their Dream Team points generally.\nIn other words, we are inferring from a sample a general relationship. You can imagine that if we had a different sample, a linear regression model would have a different set of estimates for our intercept and coefficient. They would (hopefully) look very similar to the ones we found above, but they would be slightly different. For example, imagine that some of the random elements of a game of AFL were different: the wind blew in a different way, the crowd cheered a little louder, a player ran a little faster. These would change the game played in slight and random ways. A player might make a clanger instead of a clean disposal. The wind may blow an otherwise goal into a behind. Consequently, the players’ disposal efficiency would be slightly different. We would subsequently get different model estimates.\nLet’s illustrate this. To be able to access this variation to illustrate my point, I am going to take pure random samples from our 379 players. Let’s take a completely random sample of 250 players from our data and fit our regression against that sample:\n\nafl_sample_1 &lt;- afl_df |&gt; \n  sample_n(250) |&gt;\n  select(player.player.player.givenName, \n         player.player.player.surname,\n         dreamTeamPoints,\n         disposalEfficiency)\nafl_sample_1\n\n# A tibble: 250 × 4\n   player.player.player.givenName player.player.player.surname dreamTeamPoints\n   &lt;chr&gt;                          &lt;chr&gt;                                  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Bridie                         Hipwell                                   17\n 2 Katherine                      Smith                                     39\n 3 Julie                          O'Sullivan                                29\n 4 Amy                            Franklin                                  30\n 5 Taylah                         Gatt                                      41\n 6 Brooke                         Lochland                                  56\n 7 Ruby                           Sargent-Wilson                            51\n 8 Rene                           Caris                                     14\n 9 Montana                        Ham                                       46\n10 Isabel                         Huntington                                49\n# ℹ 240 more rows\n# ℹ 1 more variable: disposalEfficiency &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\nm_1 &lt;- lm(dreamTeamPoints ~ disposalEfficiency, data = afl_sample_1)\n\ntidy(m_1)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term               estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)         44.9       5.43        8.28 7.92e-15\n2 disposalEfficiency   0.0885    0.0834      1.06 2.89e- 1\n\n\nOkay, so we got a different intercept and coefficient estimates than we got above.

The only difference was pure random chance.\nWe can see these differences more clearly by plotting them:\n\nafl_sample_1 |&gt; \n  mutate(sample = \"One\") |&gt; \n  bind_rows(\n    mutate(afl_sample_2, sample = \"Two\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  bind_rows(\n    mutate(afl_sample_3, sample = \"Three\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = disposalEfficiency, y = dreamTeamPoints, colour = sample)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = F) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of our pure random samples led our model to estimate a slightly different relationship between disposal efficiency and Dream Team points. For example, sample one leads us to believe that a one percentage point increase in a player’s disposal efficiency is associated with a 0.09 point increase in their Dream Team points, on average. Model 3, on the other hand, would suggest that this same change in disposal efficiency is associated with a 0.19 point increase in a player’s Dream Team points, on average.\nLet’s do this 1,000 times and take a look at the range of different estimates produced by random chance. First, I write a function that takes a random sample of 250 players from the full player list. It then fits a linear regression model using that sample. Finally, it returns the coefficients for that model in a format that is easy for us to work with.\n\nafl_sample_regression &lt;- function(i) {\n  \n  afl_sample &lt;- sample_n(afl_df, 250)\n  \n  m &lt;- lm(dreamTeamPoints ~ disposalEfficiency, data = afl_sample)\n  \n  model_results &lt;- tibble(trial = i, model = tidy(m))\n  \n  return(model_results)\n  \n}\n\nafl_regressions &lt;- map(1:1000, afl_sample_regression, .progress = T) |&gt; \n  bind_rows()\n\nNow we can take a look at those different regression coefficients:\n\nunnest(afl_regressions, model)\n\n# A tibble: 2,000 × 6\n   trial term               estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     1 (Intercept)         44.2       5.76        7.67 3.80e-13\n 2     1 disposalEfficiency   0.103     0.0873      1.18 2.40e- 1\n 3     2 (Intercept)         44.3       5.73        7.73 2.60e-13\n 4     2 disposalEfficiency   0.108     0.0870      1.24 2.16e- 1\n 5     3 (Intercept)         45.5       5.62        8.10 2.54e-14\n 6     3 disposalEfficiency   0.112     0.0843      1.32 1.87e- 1\n 7     4 (Intercept)         42.7       5.52        7.73 2.66e-13\n 8     4 disposalEfficiency   0.104     0.0842      1.23 2.19e- 1\n 9     5 (Intercept)         45.6       5.85        7.79 1.88e-13\n10     5 disposalEfficiency   0.0923    0.0883      1.05 2.97e- 1\n# ℹ 1,990 more rows\n\n\nThis shows the intercept and coefficient for the relationship between disposal efficiency and Dream Team points for each of the models we generated from our 1,000 different random samples. Remember, the only thing driving the differences between each model’s intercept and coefficient is random chance.\nLet’s start with the disposal efficiency coefficients:\n\nafl_regressions |&gt; \n  unnest(model) |&gt; \n  filter(term == \"disposalEfficiency\") |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = estimate)) + \n  stat_halfeye() + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Coefficient estimate\",\n       y = \"Density\",\n       caption = \"Median is shown with point. One and two standard deviations are shown by the black bars.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the distribution of those 1,000 different coefficients for disposal efficiency for each model. We can see a wide range of estimates for the relationship between disposal efficiency and Dream Team points. Some samples even led our model to estimate a negative relationship!\nNext, we can look at the intercept estimates:\n\nafl_regressions |&gt; \n  unnest(model) |&gt; \n  filter(term == \"(Intercept)\") |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = estimate)) + \n  stat_halfeye() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Coefficient estimate\",\n       y = \"Density\",\n       caption = \"Median is shown with point. One and two standard deviations are shown by the black bars.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, we have a wide range of estimates. Some are more common than others: the average of our 1,000 estimates (43.637) is the most common one produced. Estimates far from that average are less common. Similarly, the average of the 1,000 estimates produced for the disposal efficiency variable (0.115) was the most common one produced.\nWe can use this knowledge to focus back on that single regression model that we built right at the start of this session. Those averages are very, very close to the estimates produced by that first model:\n\nsummary(m)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = dreamTeamPoints ~ disposalEfficiency, data = afl_df)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-51.16 -18.77  -4.29  14.42 115.49 \n\nCoefficients:\n                   Estimate Std.

    "text": "Building uncertainty into our single regression model\nGenerally, we have a single sample that we need to use to fit our models. We still need to account for the uncertainty (demonstrated above) created by random chance. Unfortunately, we only have one sample. We, therefore, need to estimate the sampling distribution that would arise from an infinite number of samples from our population using this one lonely sample. To do this, we assume that the estimates our one sample produced are (close to) the estimates that would be produced by a model fit against the population. So, we center our estimated sampling distributions at these best guesses.\n\ntidy(m) |&gt; \n  select(term, estimate)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  term               estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)          43.5  \n2 disposalEfficiency    0.116\n\n\nThese are our best guesses at the true linear relationship between disposal efficiency and Dream Team points. Our best guess is that players who have a disposal efficiency of zero have, on average, 43.5 Dream Team points. Every one percentage point increase in a player’s efficiency is associated with a gain of 0.12 Dream Team points, on average.\nNow, we need to build out the plausible set of intercepts and coefficients that would result from an infinite number of random samples drawn from our population. To do this, we need to work out how spread out these intercepts and coefficients would be from their center points. Formally, this spread is called the standard deviation.\nThe standard deviation, \\(s\\), is calculated using two pieces of information. First, it looks at how well our line of best fit (our regression model) fits our observed data. How far are the predicted values (represented by the blue line on the below graph) from the observed values (represented by the black dots)?\n\nggplot(afl_df, aes(x = disposalEfficiency, y = dreamTeamPoints)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = F) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will have more uncertainty around our intercept and coefficient if the distance between the predicted values and observed values is large. This makes sense: if the predicted values and the observed values were very similar, we are unlikely to find a wildly different line of best fit from a different random sample from our population.\nThe standard deviation also takes into account the amount of information you have used to generate this intercept and coefficient. Greater sample sizes using less variables result in less uncertainty around those model coefficients.\nIn sum, the standard deviation is calculated as:\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum{e_i^2}}{n-k-1}}\n\\]\nWhere \\(e_i\\) is the difference between each predicted value and observed value (the vertical distance between each point and the blue line on the graph above).\n\\(n-k-1\\) is the degrees of freedom in the model. It accounts for the amount of information you used to build the model, with \\(n\\) equal to the number of observations you used and \\(k\\) equal to the number of independent variables you included. Here, our \\(n =\\) 379 because that’s the number of observations (players) we used to fit the model, and \\(k=1\\) because we are only using one independent variable: disposal efficiency.\nWe can use this spread to work out our standard errors around our coefficients. Broadly, the standard error places this uncertainty within the context of the model.\nFor the intercept, it is:\n\\[\nSE_{\\beta_0} = s(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{\\bar{x}^2}{\\sum{(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}}})\n\\]\nFor the coefficients, it is:\n\\[\nSE_{\\beta_1} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{\\sum{(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou will calculate all of this in the background. Do not worry about memorizing these formulas. I put them here to help build your intuition about what goes into your uncertainty around the relationship you find between your outcome of interest and the variables you think drive that outcome.\n\n\nHappily, broom::tidy() calculates all of this for us:\n\ntidy(m) |&gt; \n  select(term:std.error)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  term               estimate std.error\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)          43.5      4.43  \n2 disposalEfficiency    0.116    0.0675\n\n\nOkay, so we have a good sense of the spread around our best guess. Let’s visualize this. We will start with the disposal efficiency coefficient estimate:\n\ntibble(\n  x = rnorm(1e6, \n            mean = tidy(m) |&gt; filter(term == \"disposalEfficiency\") |&gt; pull(estimate),\n            sd = tidy(m) |&gt; filter(term == \"disposalEfficiency\") |&gt; pull(std.error))\n) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = x)) + \n  stat_halfeye() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Coefficient estimate\",\n       y = \"Density\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove, we show the plausible set of coefficients describing the effect of a one percentage point increase in a player’s disposal efficiency on their Dream Team points, on average. Remember, our best guess (taken from our regression model) is that a one percentage point increase in efficiency is associated with a 0.12 increase in a player’s Dream Team points, on average. However, as we saw above when we built 1,000 different models from 1,000 different random samples, it is entirely plausible that we could get different coefficients from a model built from a different sample. These differences are the product of random chance. That’s fine! We just need to acknowledge that.\nLet’s also visualize all of the plausible intercepts we could get:\n\ntibble(\n  x = rnorm(1e6, \n            mean = tidy(m) |&gt; filter(term == \"(Intercept)\") |&gt; pull(estimate),\n            sd = tidy(m) |&gt; filter(term == \"(Intercept)\") |&gt; pull(std.error))\n) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = x)) + \n  stat_halfeye() + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, our best guess is that players who have a disposal efficiency of zero have, on average, 43.5 Dream Team points. This is one of many plausible intercepts that we could generate."

    "text": "Connecting this to our research question\nWe used our data to uncover an interesting relationship between disposal efficiency and Dream Team points. On average, as your disposal efficiency increases, so too do your Dream Team points. We found that if players who increased their disposal efficiency by one percentage point saw an increase of 0.12 Dream Team points, on average.\nNow, imagine that you are a player and you want to increase your Dream Team points. Do you trust this? Do you really believe that by increasing your disposal efficiency you will increase your Dream Team points? What if, in fact, there is no relationship between these two variables?\nWe know from above that there are a range of plausible intercepts and coefficients that result from random chance. Does this plausible range include zero? In other words, is it plausible that there is no relationship between the outcome of interest (Dream Team points) and your independent variable (disposal efficiency)?\nFirst, we need to define what we mean by a plausible range of relationships. Traditionally, we are willing to accept a five percent risk that we declare that there is a relationship between an outcome and an independent variable when there is, in fact, no relationship. Let’s stick with that threshold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe political science journal articles you have read will often talk about a p-value of 0.05. This threshold of a five percent risk that we declare that there is a relationship between an outcome and an independent variable when there is, in fact, no relationship is the functional definition of that p-value.\n\n\nOkay, so now we need to work out where the other 95 percent of plausible values sit. Let’s start with the coefficient describing the relationship between Dream Team points and disposal efficiency. Here is our representation of the coefficients drawn from an infinite number random samples pulled from our population (it is the same as printed above):\n\ntibble(\n  x = rnorm(1e6, \n            mean = tidy(m) |&gt; filter(term == \"disposalEfficiency\") |&gt; pull(estimate),\n            sd = tidy(m) |&gt; filter(term == \"disposalEfficiency\") |&gt; pull(std.error))\n) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = x)) + \n  stat_halfeye() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Coefficient estimate\",\n       y = \"Density\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere do 95 percent of these coefficients fall around our best guess? Because we estimated the spread of our estimates using the standard error, we cannot use the usual (and helpful) standard Normal distribution to answer this question. Instead, we need to look at a similar, but different distribution: the t-distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe t-distribution\n\n\n\nThe t-distribution is very similar to the Normal distribution, but it depends on one important factor that the Normal distribution does not: the amount of information you used to fit your model.\nThere are an infinite number of t-distributions. Each is defined by its degrees of freedom. Degrees of freedom account for both the number of observations and the number of independent variables you used to fit your model. We will discuss how to use the t-distribution below, but for now here are some t-distributions with different degrees of freedom:\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_density(aes(x = rt(1e6, df = 5)), colour = \"red\") +\n  geom_density(aes(x = rt(1e6, df = 50)), colour = \"blue\") +\n  geom_density(aes(x = rt(1e6, df = 5000)), colour = \"grey\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-5, 5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe important thing to note here is that the t-distribution punishes you for using too little information to fit your models. The tails on the distribution with the smallest degrees of freedom (coloured in red) are fatter than the distributions with higher degrees of freedom. As you will learn below, this makes the bar required to reach statistical significance more difficult to clear.\nAnother thing to note is that this effect is diminishing in the amount of information (degrees of freedom) you have. Note that the difference between the distribution with five degrees of freedom and that with 50 is much larger than the difference between the distribution with 50 degrees of freedom and that with 5000. Practically, once you have more than a few observations and you do not cram your model with many independent variables, you will not be punished too harshly.\nFinally, as the degrees of freedom increase, the t-distribution increasingly resembles the Normal distribution.\n\n\nWe need to use our knowledge of the t-distribution to answer this question. We know that center point (our coefficient):\n\nbeta_1 &lt;- tidy(m) |&gt; \n  filter(term == \"disposalEfficiency\") |&gt; \n  pull(estimate)\nbeta_1\n\n[1] 0.1162632\n\n\nWe know how spread out our alternative coefficients are from that center point (our standard error):\n\nse_beta_1 &lt;- tidy(m) |&gt; \n  filter(term == \"disposalEfficiency\") |&gt; \n  pull(std.error)\nse_beta_1\n\n[1] 0.06750683\n\n\nAnd we know our threshold (5%). We need to translate that threshold into its t-statistic, accounting for the degrees of freedom we have access to:\n\nsample_size &lt;- nrow(afl_df)\nsample_size\n\n[1] 379\n\nno_of_IVs &lt;- 1\nno_of_IVs\n\n[1] 1\n\ndf &lt;- sample_size - no_of_IVs - 1\ndf\n\n[1] 377\n\n\nTherefore:\n\nt_stat_95 &lt;- qt(0.025, df = df, lower.tail = F)\nt_stat_95\n\n[1] 1.966276\n\n\nThis is the point beyond which 2.5% of all values along the t-distribution fall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRemember, we want to find out where 95 percent of these alternative coefficients sit around the center point. So, we need to distribute our remaining five percent between the two tails. That’s why we find the t-statistic beyond which 2.5% of the data fall.\n\n\nNow we can find the boundaries within which 95 percent of these alternative coefficients fall using the following formula:\n\\[\nCI = \\beta_1 \\pm t*SE_{\\beta_1}\n\\]\n\nlower_ci &lt;- beta_1 - t_stat_95*se_beta_1\nlower_ci\n\n[1] -0.01647391\n\nupper_ci &lt;- beta_1 + t_stat_95*se_beta_1\nupper_ci\n\n[1] 0.2490003\n\n\nLet’s place those in context:\n\ntibble(\n  x = rnorm(1e6, \n            mean = tidy(m) |&gt; filter(term == \"disposalEfficiency\") |&gt; pull(estimate),\n            sd = tidy(m) |&gt; filter(term == \"disposalEfficiency\") |&gt; pull(std.error))\n) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = x)) + \n  stat_slab(aes(fill_ramp = after_stat(x &lt; lower_ci | x &gt; upper_ci))) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") + \n  labs(x = \"Coefficient estimate\",\n       y = \"Density\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrilliant! Now we know where 95 percent of all alternative coefficients drawn from a random sample of our population could fall. These are our plausible alternative coefficients.\nSo, do these plausible alternatives include zero? In other words, is it plausible that there is no relationship between a player’s disposal efficiency and their Dream Team points?\n\ntibble(\n  x = rnorm(1e6, \n            mean = tidy(m) |&gt; filter(term == \"disposalEfficiency\") |&gt; pull(estimate),\n            sd = tidy(m) |&gt; filter(term == \"disposalEfficiency\") |&gt; pull(std.error))\n) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = x)) + \n  stat_slab(aes(fill_ramp = after_stat(x &lt; lower_ci | x &gt; upper_ci))) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") + \n  labs(x = \"Coefficient estimate\",\n       y = \"Density\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes! A null relationship sits within our plausible set of coefficients for disposal efficiency. We cannot reject the notion that there is no relationship between disposal efficiency and Dream Team points at this threshold.\nWhat about a more forgiving threshold? What if we are willing to accept a 10 percent chance that we reject a true null relationship?\nFirst, we need to find this new threshold’s t-statistic:\n\nt_stat_90 &lt;- qt(0.05, df = df, lower.tail = F)\nt_stat_90\n\n[1] 1.648905\n\n\nAnd; therefore, our new boundaries (within which 90 percent of alternative coefficients sit):\n\nlower_ci &lt;- beta_1 - t_stat_90*se_beta_1\nlower_ci\n\n[1] 0.004950792\n\nupper_ci &lt;- beta_1 + t_stat_90*se_beta_1\nupper_ci\n\n[1] 0.2275756\n\n\nDo these contain a null relationship?\n\ntibble(\n  x = rnorm(1e6, \n            mean = tidy(m) |&gt; filter(term == \"disposalEfficiency\") |&gt; pull(estimate),\n            sd = tidy(m) |&gt; filter(term == \"disposalEfficiency\") |&gt; pull(std.error))\n) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = x)) + \n  stat_slab(aes(fill_ramp = after_stat(x &lt; lower_ci | x &gt; upper_ci))) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") + \n  labs(x = \"Coefficient estimate\",\n       y = \"Density\") + \n  labs(x = \"Coefficient estimate\",\n       y = \"Density\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo! So, if we are happy to accept a 10 percent risk that we will believe a relationship exists where one, if fact, does not, we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between disposal efficiency and Dream Team points. We can tell the players that we have found a statistically significant relationship between disposal efficiency and Dream Team points at the 0.1 threshold.\nWe can approach this question from the other direction. If the null hypothesis were true, how likely would we be to see our estimate?\nFirst, let’s set up our null world:\n\ntibble(\n  x = rt(1e6, df = df)\n) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = x)) + \n  stat_slab() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") + \n  labs(x = \"t\",\n       y = \"Density\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am back to random draws from our t-distribution.\nHere, we have centered our distribution of alternative coefficients (resulting only from differences in our samples brought about by random chance) at zero. We are in the null world: there is no relationship between disposal efficiency and Dream Team points.\nWhere does the estimate we found in our sample sit within this null world? First, we need to translate that observed estimate into its t-statistic:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\beta_1}{SE_{\\beta_1}}\n\\]\n\nt_stat &lt;- beta_1 / se_beta_1\nt_stat\n\n[1] 1.722243\n\n\nLet’s place this in the context of the null world:\n\ntibble(\n  x = rt(1e6, df = df)\n) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = x)) + \n  stat_slab() + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = t_stat) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow likely is it that I would get this coefficient or a more extreme coefficient if we did, in fact, live in the null world? In other words, what proportion of these alternative coefficients (highlighted in dark gray on the graph below) are equal to or more extreme than our observed estimate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRemember that we are conducting a two-tailed test of our null hypothesis. We need to be open to the estimate being greater or smaller than the null.\n\n\n\ntibble(\n  x = rt(1e6, df = df)\n) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = x)) + \n  stat_slab(aes(fill_ramp = after_stat(x &lt; -t_stat | x &gt; t_stat))) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = t_stat) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proportion of alternative coefficients that are equal to or more extreme than the one we observed is:\n\np_value &lt;- 2 * pt(t_stat, df = df, lower.tail = F)\np_value\n\n[1] 0.08584565\n\n\nWe would observe an estimate of 0.116 or a more extreme estimate 9% of the time if the null hypothesis were true. When we are only happy to accept a five percent chance that we would reject a true null hypothesis, we cannot reject that null hypothesis. If, on the other hand, we are happy to accept a 10 percent chance that we reject a true null hypothesis, we can reject it."

Well, we know from the standard error (std.error) how spread out around that best guess alternative coefficients sit.\nWe know where our estimate (translated into its t-statistic, or statistic) sits within the null world.\nAnd finally, we know the probability (p.value) that we would observe the estimate we found if it were actually equal to zero.\nAll of that work we did above is replicated here, in this one line of code.

I will step through both options now.\n\nCode chunks\nA code chunk starts with ```{r} and ends with ```. You can then write whole “chunks” of code that will output in your rendered document.\nFor example, I will load the tidyverse R package into my current session:\n```{r}\n#| echo: true\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\nYou can specify your chunk options using #| at the start of the line. For example, above I specified that I wanted the code in the code chunk to be shown when I render my document. You can hide the code by changing the chunk option echo to false. There are many different chunk options that you can control. A full list can be found here.\nYou can set the chunk options in the individual chunks, as show above. Alternatively, you can set them universally in the YAML section at the top of your Quarto document using the execute command. For example:\n```{yaml}\nexecute:\n  echo: true\n  message: false\n  warning: false\n```\nThis will apply to all code chunks unless you overwrite it by including chunk-specific options in a code chunk.\nCode chunks are useful for running large amounts of code. Commonly, I use them to include a plot, a regression table, or to read in my data or model results. For example, you can write the code to create a ggplot directly in your document.\n\n\n\nSource: Quarto\n\n\n\n\nIn-line code\nYou will often want to reference numbers or results in your prose. For example, I may be writing up the data section of a paper and want to specify that my data set includes 100 observations. If I were to write this in normally and then go away and collect more data, I would need to come back and update this number manually to reflect my new number of observations. I may do this several times (very tedious) or I may miss a time (we are all human). In-line coding allows you to make these updates programmatically.\nYou include R code directly in your prose using the expression: r. For example:\n\nWill render as: There are r nrow(mpg) observations in our data. No need to go and update this reference if that number changes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nscales is a great R package for formatting numbers.\nFor example, R will output raw numbers such as 1000000000 and 8932348920. scales allows you to format these numbers so they are easier to read: scales::comma(1000000000) gives you r scales::comma(1000000000) and scales::dollar(8932348920) gives you r scales::dollar(8932348920).\n\n\nYou can use Quarto to produce all kinds of fully reproducible documents, including journal articles and reports. You can also use it to produce very professional-looking presentations. Finally, you can even use it to produce websites. In fact, all of the resources provided to you here were produced in Quarto."

For example, you can write a function that takes entire data frames, fits models against those data frames, and provides summary statistics and various plots of those models. These more complex functions follow the same format introduced to you above. As you build your R skills, you will find more opportunities to write increasingly complex and robust functions.\nYou should not keep those functions to yourself! You should share them with others, who may also be struggling with verbose code. If you have a group of functions that perform similar tasks, you should write them up into an R package. For example, you might want to write a series of functions that perform common conversions. You can add a weight converter to the temperature converter we wrote above.\nR packages require a little bit more work. For example, you need to provide all that helpful documentation you have been referring to when using others’ functions. You will also need to run a series of robustness checks to make sure users’ code doesn’t break if they add something unusual to your functions.\nHowever, packages can be very rewarding to produce. For example, I hope you have found polisciols very helpful! I also had the opportunity to work with the UN and some amazing R coders to write comtradr, an R package that allows users to access the UN Comtrade API from R. There are many opportunities to work with organizations and others when coding in R.\nTo get started building your own R packages, you should check out the helpfully titled R Packages by Hadley Wickham (of R4DS fame) and Jennifer Bryan."

We recommend getting an early start: you need to complete all the content, quizzes, and the final exam before your first week of classes.\nThe course comprises ten substantive sessions. You should complete these in order: each builds on the previous sessions. Each includes some written content, a worked example of the concepts being discussed, and relevant R code. Some include short recorded lectures.\nEach session ends with a mandatory multiple-choice quiz (taken through ELMs). You need to obtain a score of X percent or higher on each session’s quiz before you can move on to the next one. There are no limits on the number of times you can attempt the quiz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe understand that some of you are coming into the APAN M.S. program with a strong background in statistics and R. If you are familiar with the topics covered in a given session, you can “test-out” of it by obtaining a mark of X percent or higher on its multiple-choice quiz before starting its content.\n\n\nYou will also complete a final exam at the end of the course. All material covered in all ten sessions will be tested.\n\nIntroduction to R\nWe also provide an optional introduction to R. If you have no background in R or would like to brush up on your coding skills (including your familiarity with the tidyverse), I suggest that you start there.\nYou will find it in the Introduction to R section of the course website. It includes seven short sessions that will introduce you to:\n\nR and RStudio\nData visualization\nData transformation\nData wrangling\nData merging\nData programming\nCommunication using Quarto and markdown.\n\nAfter completing this introduction, you will be comfortable using this important tool for data analysis.

    "text": "Introduction\nThus far, we have focused on identifying patterns and relationships within our data. We have learnt how to look through the noise to identify how our variables change with one another. As our independent variables change, does our dependent variable increase, decrease, or stay the same? When paired with causal theory, we are armed with tools to help us make sense of the complex world of politics and social behavior more broadly.\nWe have not, however, yet discussed what that noise all means for our confidence in the patterns and relationships we have uncovered. These final two sessions will focus on the question of uncertainty. How confident can we be that the relationships we uncover in our data are real, and not just the product of random noise?\nTo answer this question of uncertainty, you need a quick refresher or introduction to probability theory. This topic tends to be soaked in abstraction: Greek letters tend to abound. This method has never worked for me: I like to see what is going on under the hood. As such, I will introduce you to these concepts using simulations and illustrations. I will include the Greek letters so you can read the dusty old textbooks that tend to accompany more advanced statistics courses. But please keep in mind that probability can be more straightforward than the statisticians would have you believe!\nLet’s get started!"

    "text": "First, some philosophy…\nThere are two approaches to interpreting probability: frequentism and Bayesianism. The dominant approach in social science is frequentism, so that’s what we will focus on. However, it is useful to understand where both come from.\nFrequentists argue that probabilities are the proportion of times an event occurs over an infinite number of identical trials. To illustrate, consider the probability of getting heads when you flip a coin. Frequentists would argue that it is the number of times you get a head after flipping a coin an infinite number of times divided by the number of trials you ran (infinity).\nHmm… we cannot flip a coin an infinite number of times and you cannot divide something by infinity. Frequentists, therefore, need to make do with approximating probabilities. They do this by replacing the infinite number of trials with a very large number of trials. For example, they find that if you flip a coin one million times you tend to get heads half a million times. Therefore, the probability of getting heads when you flip a coin is 0.5 (or 50%).\nBayesians have a different approach. They believe probabilities represent your subjective beliefs, which are informed by your knowledge and experience of the event. These subjective beliefs are constantly being updated based on new information you receive. For example, a Bayesian may start with the belief that the probability of getting heads is 0.8 (or 80%). They believe that if you flip a coin 100 times, you will get 80 heads. You then go ahead and flip that coin 100 times and instead you get 50 heads. The Bayesian will then update their belief about the probability of flipping the coin. They will not discard their prior belief; instead they will move their belief closer to what they observed. They may split the difference and update their belief to a probability of 0.65. Every time you run your trial (flipping the coin 100 times and reporting the number of heads) they will update their beliefs based on this new information and their prior.\nEach approach has its critics. You, of course, cannot flip a coin an infinite number of times, so frequentists have defined their way out of ever having precise probabilities. Critics of Bayesianism argue that subjective beliefs should not influence empirical analysis. We will focus on frequentism moving forward, but if you are interesting in learning more about the Bayesian approach I recommend this fantastic introductory book (in R): Bayes Rules! An Introduction to Applied Bayesian Modeling by Alicia A. Johnson, Miles Q. Ott, Mine Dogucu."

    "text": "Axioms of probability\nProbability theory rests on three basic rules. First, the probability of any event, A, is non-negative. Formally:\n\\[\nP(A) \\ge 0\n\\]\nFor example, the probability of getting a head cannot be negative. It must be zero or positive.\nSecond, the probability of all possible events (the sample space, or \\(\\Omega\\)) is equal to one. Formally:\n\\[\nP(\\Omega) = 1\n\\]\nFor example, all possible events that could result from a coin flip are heads or tails. Therefore, the probability that you will get a head or a tail is equal to one.\nThird, if events cannot occur at the same time (they are mutually exclusive), then the probability that each occurs is equal to the sum of the probabilities that each individually occurs. Formally:\n\\[\nP(A\\ or\\ B) = P(A) + P(B)\n\\]\nFor example, you cannot flip a coin and get both heads and tails. Therefore, these outcomes are mutually exclusive. The probability of getting heads or tails when flipping a fair coin is:\n\\[\nP(H\\ or\\ T) = P(H) + P(T) = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1\n\\]\nFrom these three basic rules, we can derive all of probability theory! Put together, they imply that probabilities range from zero to one and that the probability of all possible outcomes from some trial must add up to one."

    "section": "Probability distributions",
    "text": "Probability distributions\nWe are interested in learning how likely an outcome is to occur. We can assign outcomes a random variable, which is simply a numeric representation of that event. For example, I might define a coin landing on heads a random variable of 1. I can also define a coin not landing on heads a random variable of 0.\nEach random variable has a probability distribution. This defines the likelihood that each outcome will occur. I will focus on two such distributions: the Bernoulli and the Normal distribution.\nBernoulli distribution\nThe Bernoulli distribution is the probability distribution of a binary variable. For example, here is the Bernoulli distribution of a fair coin toss:\n\ntibble(x = rbinom(1e6, 1, 0.5)) |&gt; \n  count(x) |&gt; \n  mutate(x = if_else(x == 1, \"HEAD\", \"TAIL\"),\n         prop = n / sum(n)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = prop)) + \n  geom_col() + \n  labs(x = \"Event\",\n       y = \"Probability\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the Bernoulli distribution of a coin that lands on tails 75 percent of the time:\n\ntibble(x = rbinom(1e6, 1, 0.25)) |&gt; \n  count(x) |&gt; \n  mutate(x = if_else(x == 1, \"HEAD\", \"TAIL\"),\n         prop = n / sum(n)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = prop)) + \n  geom_col() + \n  labs(x = \"Event\",\n       y = \"Probability\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do you find an event’s Bernoulli distribution? Recall that frequentists conduct a large number of trials and tally up the number of each outcome that occurs across those trials. The probability of each outcome is just that count of occurances divided by the total number of trials they ran.\nTo demonstrate, I am going to create a coin in R. I am not going to tell you whether this coin is fair.\n\nReveal the coinflip_coin &lt;- function(n) {\n  \n  if_else(rbinom(n = n, size = 1, prob = 0.8) == 1, \"HEADS\", \"TAILS\")\n  \n}\n\n\nHidden in that code block is my coin (you can take a look at it at the end of this section). To flip the coin, we simply run the following code:\n\nflip_coin(1)\n\n[1] \"HEADS\"\n\n\n\nflip_coin(1)\n\n[1] \"HEADS\"\n\n\n\nflip_coin(1)\n\n[1] \"HEADS\"\n\n\nSo, your task is to find the Bernoulli distribution of this coin. In other words, how likely are you to flip heads and how likely are you to flip tails?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBecause the probability of all possible outcomes needs to add up to one (see axiom number two) and we only have two possible outcomes, you can choose one outcome (heads or tails), record the number of times that outcome occurs, and divide it by the number of trials you run (coin flips). You can then subtract that probability from one to get the probability of the other outcome.\n\n\nWe are going to flip our coin one million times (thankfully R can do this very quickly). Each time we flip the coin, we will record its outcome (heads or tails). At the end, we will have conducted our very large number of trials and should have a good frequentist approximation of the true Bernoulli distribution of our coin.\n\nresults &lt;- tibble(trial = 1:1e6,\n                  outcome = flip_coin(1e6))\n\nresults\n\n# A tibble: 1,000,000 × 2\n   trial outcome\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  \n 1     1 HEADS  \n 2     2 HEADS  \n 3     3 TAILS  \n 4     4 HEADS  \n 5     5 HEADS  \n 6     6 HEADS  \n 7     7 HEADS  \n 8     8 HEADS  \n 9     9 HEADS  \n10    10 TAILS  \n# ℹ 999,990 more rows\n\n\nOkay, so we now have the results of our one million trials. Let’s tally them up:\n\napprox_dist &lt;- tabyl(results, outcome)\napprox_dist\n\n outcome      n  percent\n   HEADS 799748 0.799748\n   TAILS 200252 0.200252\n\n\nIn our one million trials, we got heads 799,748 times (or 80% of the time). We got tails 200,252 times (or 20% of the time). Let’s visualize this:\n\nggplot(approx_dist, aes(x = outcome, y = percent)) + \n  geom_col() + \n  labs(x = \"Event\",\n       y = \"Probability\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, do you think the coin is fair? No! It’s stacked towards heads. Let’s look at the true Bernoulli distribution of this coin:\n\nflip_coin\n\nfunction (n) \n{\n    if_else(rbinom(n = n, size = 1, prob = 0.8) == 1, \"HEADS\", \n        \"TAILS\")\n}\n&lt;bytecode: 0x117906240&gt;\n\n\nFocus on the rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = 0.8) part of the function. The third argument (prob) is the probability that rbinom() will return a one (the random variable I have assigned to heads). I set it to 0.8 (or 80%). So, our large number of trials approximated - with a good amount of precision - the Bernoulli distribution of this coin.\nNormal distribution\nThe Normal distribution is another common distribution that is critical to regression and modelling more broadly. We will discuss that connection in the next session.\nThe Normal distribution is symmetric, bell-shaped. Here it is visually:\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_density(aes(x = rnorm(1e6, mean = 0, sd = 1))) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shape of this bell-curve relies on two things: first, the mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and second, the variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)). The mean determines the center of the distribution. In the plot above, the Normal distribution is centered at its mean of zero.\nThe variance determines how spread out away from that mean the distribution is. The plot above has a standard deviation (which is the square root of the variance (I know… I also don’t know why they just stick with standard deviation…)) of one. Let’s compare this to a Normal distribution with the same mean but with a standard deviation of two:\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_density(aes(x = rnorm(1e6, mean = 0, sd = 1)), colour = \"red\") + \n  geom_density(aes(x = rnorm(1e6, mean = 0, sd = 2)), colour = \"blue\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Normal distribution with a larger variance (in blue) is more spread out around the center. It is also much shorter than the Normal distribution with the smaller variance. It might be helpful to think of a bucket containing a gallon of water. If you replace that bucket with a wider one, the gallon of water will fill that wider space and will be shallower in the bucket. When we increase the variance of the Normal distribution, we increase the space within which that same volume of outcomes can fall.\nJust to introduce you to the Greek letters, here is how we write the Normal distribution formally:\n\\[\nX \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\n\\]\nThe original Normal distribution plotted above is:\n\\[\nX \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1^2)\n\\]\nThis Normal distribution (with a mean of zero and a variance of one) is referred to as the standard Normal distribution. It is a wonderfully handy distribution that we will discuss in more detail shortly.\nWhat does this have to do with probability? Well, it turns out that many statistics of many trials follow the Normal distribution. Let me demonstrate. Let’s flip a coin 10,000 times, recording the number of heads those coins land on (our statistic), and then repeat that process 1,000 times. We will use a fair coin this time.\n\nrun_n_trials &lt;- function(n) {\n  \n  trial &lt;- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5)\n\n  result &lt;- tabyl(trial) |&gt; \n    filter(trial == 1) |&gt; \n    pull(percent)\n  \n  return(result)\n  \n}\n\nresults &lt;- tibble(trial = 1:1000) |&gt; \n  rowwise() |&gt; \n  mutate(prop_heads = run_n_trials(10000)) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\nresults\n\n# A tibble: 1,000 × 2\n   trial prop_heads\n   &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     1      0.495\n 2     2      0.494\n 3     3      0.501\n 4     4      0.498\n 5     5      0.496\n 6     6      0.494\n 7     7      0.506\n 8     8      0.504\n 9     9      0.495\n10    10      0.493\n# ℹ 990 more rows\n\n\nNow, let’s plot the distribution of the proportion of heads that resulted from each 10,000 coin flips in our 1,000 trials:\n\nggplot(results, aes(x = prop_heads)) + \n  geom_density() + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s (a slightly wonky) Normal distribution. Formally, we would say this is approximately Normally distributed. Also, look at that center point: it’s very close to 0.5 (the true underlying probability of flipping heads). If we did many more trials we would get increasingly close to a Normal distribution (the Central Limit Theorem) and that Normal distribution would be centered at 0.5 (the Law of Large Numbers).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem states that the standardized sample mean of some event, \\(X\\), can increasingly be approximated by the standard Normal distribution as the sample size increases.\nThe Law of Large Numbers states that the sample mean of \\(X\\) increasingly approximates the population mean of \\(X\\) as the sample size increases.\n\n\nIt’s important to note that not all trials resulted in 50% heads. Why? We set up a fair coin (rbinom(1, 1, prob = 0.5)), and yet some trials appear to have resulted in far fewer heads than tails and some resulted in many more heads than tails. Trial number 418 only landed on heads 48% of the time. Trial number 796, on the other hand, landed on heads 51% of the time.\nThis is the result of random noise. There’s no way around this. If you were to pick up a coin and flip it a couple of times, you would probably get runs of heads and runs of tails despite that coin being fair. But, happily, the most likely outcome from our trials was (close to) the true underlying probability of 0.5. Most of our trials of 10,000 coin flips resulted in 5,000 heads or very close to 5,000 heads. Those extremes (much less or much more than 5,000 heads) were very rare.\nWhat we can take from this is that a single trial may not give us the true underlying statistic we are after. Flipping a coin 10,000 times and recording the proportion of outcomes that were heads may not provide us with the true underlying probability that the coin will land on heads. However, if we run many trials of 10,000 coin flips we will increasingly get closer to that true underlying probability.\nAlso, the most likely outcome of any single trial is the true underlying probability of our event. This gives us some hope for inferring from a single sample to our population (but I am getting ahead of myself)."

    "section": "Using probability distributions",
    "text": "Using probability distributions\nThe probability distribution of a Bernoulli distribution is intuitive to understand. If 80 percent of the coin flips land on heads, the probability you will get heads on any given coin flip is determined to be 0.8.\nThe probability distribution of the Normal distribution, on the other hand, is a little less intuitive. It works the same functionally: for any given outcome (for example, the coin landing on heads 60 percent of the time), the probability of that outcome is the count of the number of times it occurs divided by the number of trials you conducted. But, unlike with the Bernoulli distribution, these outcomes are not discrete. The probability density function of the Normal distribution gives us the probability for any proportion of heads from 0 to 1 (or 0 to 100 percent).\nIt is, therefore, more useful to ask what the probability of some range of outcomes occurring is. Most of the time, we are interested in learning how likely some value or a more extreme value are of occurring. For example, politicians running in elections often want to know their chances of winning. This is the probability that they will get more than 50 percent of the vote. To answer this question, we can calculate the area under the curve of the Normal distribution within our range of interest.\nThis task is made abundantly more easy when we use the standard Normal distribution (which is centered at a mean of 0 and has a variance of 1). We can convert any Normal distribution to the standard Normal distribution (similarly to how you can convert degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit, or kilograms to pounds).\nWe refer to the outcomes in a standard Normal distribution as \\(z\\). So after we convert the proportion of heads that result from a very large number of large trials from a Normal distribution to a standard Normal distribution we would refer to each possible proportion of heads as \\(z\\).\nThe standard Normal distribution has two useful properties. First, because it is symmetric and centered at 0, the probability that some outcome takes a value less than or equal to \\(-z\\) is equal to the probability that it takes a value greater than or equal to \\(z\\). To illustrate, the size of the light orange shading on the left hand side of this plot (which covers all values of \\(z\\) less than or equal to -1) is precisely equal to the size of the light orange shading to the right (which covers all values of \\(z\\) greater than or equal to 1):\n\nggplot() + \n  stat_slab(\n    aes(x = rnorm(1e6, 0, 1),\n        fill_ramp = after_stat(x &lt; -1 | x &gt; 1)), \n    fill = met.brewer(\"Egypt\")[1]\n  ) + \n  scale_fill_ramp_discrete(range = c(1, 0.2), guide = \"none\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, we know a lot of useful cut off points of this distribution. For example, we know that 95% of \\(z\\)s fall between a \\(z\\) of -1.96 and 1.96. To illustrate:\n\nggplot() + \n  stat_slab(\n    aes(x = rnorm(1e6, 0, 1),\n        fill_ramp = after_stat(x &lt; -1.96 | x &gt; 1.96)), \n    fill = met.brewer(\"Egypt\")[1]\n  ) + \n  scale_fill_ramp_discrete(range = c(1, 0.2), guide = \"none\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dark shaded area includes 95% of the probability distribution. Outcomes (\\(z\\)s) that fall below -1.96 and above 1.96 occur only 5% of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nStatistical significance is often attached to a p-value of 0.05 (or 5%). THIS IS WHERE THIS VALUE COMES FROM! Again, I am jumping ahead of myself. We will talk about this next session.\n\n\nWe can easily calculate the area under the curve of the standard Normal distribution using pnorm(). For example, here is the probability of obtaining a \\(z\\) value of -1.96 or less:\n\npnorm(-1.96)\n\n[1] 0.0249979\n\n\nHere is the probability of obtaining a \\(z\\) value of 0 or less:\n\npnorm(0)\n\n[1] 0.5\n\n\nAnd here is the probability of obtaining a \\(z\\) value of 1.96 or more:\n\npnorm(1.96, lower.tail = F)\n\n[1] 0.0249979\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\npnorm() will, by default, calculate the area under the curve starting at negative infinity (the “lower tail”) and working up to the value you provide. You can ask it to start at positive infinity and work back to the value you provide by setting lower.tail to FALSE (or F for short)."

    "text": "Standardizing your Normal random variable\nSo, how do we get from our coin flips to this very useful standard Normal distribution? We need to shift our center (mean) from whatever it is to zero and truncate or distribute the spread of our values around that center so they fall within a variance of one. The function to do this is:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\mu\\) is the mean (or center of your original Normal distribution) and \\(\\sigma\\) is its standard deviation.\nReturning to the results of our many coin flips, we can calculate the mean and standard deviation using R.\nHere are the results of our 1,000 trials of 10,000 coin flips:\n\nresults\n\n# A tibble: 1,000 × 2\n   trial prop_heads\n   &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     1      0.495\n 2     2      0.494\n 3     3      0.501\n 4     4      0.498\n 5     5      0.496\n 6     6      0.494\n 7     7      0.506\n 8     8      0.504\n 9     9      0.495\n10    10      0.493\n# ℹ 990 more rows\n\n\nThe mean of the proportion of heads flipped in each of those 1,000 trials is:\n\ncoin_mean &lt;- mean(results$prop_heads)\ncoin_mean\n\n[1] 0.5000345\n\n\nThe standard deviation is:\n\ncoin_sd &lt;- sd(results$prop_heads)\ncoin_sd\n\n[1] 0.005008006\n\n\nSo we can standardize our 1,000 trial statistics using the above formula:\n\nstandard_results &lt;- results |&gt; \n  mutate(standard_prop_heads = (prop_heads - coin_mean) / coin_sd)\n\nstandard_results\n\n# A tibble: 1,000 × 3\n   trial prop_heads standard_prop_heads\n   &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     1      0.495              -1.07 \n 2     2      0.494              -1.15 \n 3     3      0.501               0.253\n 4     4      0.498              -0.346\n 5     5      0.496              -0.786\n 6     6      0.494              -1.26 \n 7     7      0.506               1.21 \n 8     8      0.504               0.872\n 9     9      0.495              -1.07 \n10    10      0.493              -1.32 \n# ℹ 990 more rows\n\n\nLet’s plot those to make sure they look like a standard Normal distribution:\n\nggplot(standard_results, aes(x = standard_prop_heads)) + \n  geom_density() + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking good! Remember, this is simply a translation of the proportion of heads resulting from each trial we did above (it’s the same slightly wonky shape!).\nWe can now apply all the things we know about the standard Normal distribution to our distribution of the proportion of heads. For example, we can state that 95% of all possible proportions of heads that could result from our trials lie between -1.96 and 1.96 of this standard Normal distribution.\nWe can also translate this back to our proportion of heads. For example:\n\\[\n-1.96 = \\frac{X - 0.500}{0.005}\n\\]\nTherefore:\n\\[\nX = 0.4902\n\\]\nAnd:\n\\[\n1.96 = \\frac{X - 0.500}{0.005}\n\\]\nTherefore:\n\\[\nX = 0.5098\n\\]\nSo, 95 percent of all of our trials resulted in heads between 49.02 and 50.98 percent of the time. Only five percent of our trials resulted in more extreme proportions. That’s pretty good given the true probability of heads is 0.5 (or 50%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nOur distribution of the proportion of heads resulting from each trial was only approximately Normally distributed. Later, we will work with an assumed distribution which is Normally distributed."

    "text": "Working with a single sample to infer about the population\nLet’s bring this all together. Prior to November 2024, pollsters were very keen to learn the proportion of US voters who intended to vote for Kamala Harris in the 2024 general election. They could not ask all US voters of their intentions. Instead, they asked a sample of the US voting population and infered from that sample the population’s intentions. When we generalize from the sample statistic to the parameter we are engaging in statistical inference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe data point of interest among the population is referred to as the parameter. Here, it is the proportion of US voters who intended to vote for Kamala Harris in the 2024 general election. We do not know this.\nThe data point of interest among the sample is referred to as the statistic. Here, it is the proportion of survey respondents who intended to vote for Kamala Harris in the 2024 general election. We do know this.\nWe aim to have a statistic that accurately represents the parameter.\n\n\nThey wanted to know how many people intended to vote for Kamala Harris. How can we be confident that their statistic represented the parameter?\nGenerally speaking, the more our sample “looks like” our population, the more confident we can be that we have a good statistic. Drawing on probability theory, our sample is increasingly likely to resemble our population with its randomness and size (also remember back to our discussion of experiments).\nYou should strive for a large pure random sample. In a pure random sample, every individual within your population is equally likely to be drawn. This is really hard to achieve! Nonetheless, you should also strive for as large a sample as you can possibly get. More is always better in terms of statistical inference (if not your research budget or time).\nSampling error\nImagine you have a large and representative sample. You are still going to have some error. This is because your sample varies in all the normal ways events with uncertainty vary. To illustrate, let’s return to our coin flips.\nWe state our possible outcomes:\n\npossible_outcomes &lt;- c(\"HEADS\", \"TAILS\")\npossible_outcomes\n\n[1] \"HEADS\" \"TAILS\"\n\n\nWe flip our coin 100 times:\n\ncoin_flip_100 &lt;- sample(possible_outcomes, 100, replace = T, prob = c(0.5, 0.5))\ncoin_flip_100\n\n  [1] \"TAILS\" \"TAILS\" \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\" \"TAILS\" \"TAILS\" \"TAILS\" \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\"\n [10] \"HEADS\" \"TAILS\" \"TAILS\" \"TAILS\" \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\" \"TAILS\" \"TAILS\" \"TAILS\"\n [19] \"TAILS\" \"TAILS\" \"TAILS\" \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\" \"TAILS\" \"TAILS\" \"TAILS\" \"HEADS\"\n [28] \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\" \"TAILS\" \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\" \"TAILS\"\n [37] \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\" \"TAILS\" \"TAILS\" \"TAILS\" \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\" \"TAILS\" \"HEADS\"\n [46] \"HEADS\" \"TAILS\" \"HEADS\" \"TAILS\" \"TAILS\" \"HEADS\" \"TAILS\" \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\"\n [55] \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\" \"TAILS\" \"TAILS\" \"TAILS\" \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\"\n [64] \"TAILS\" \"TAILS\" \"TAILS\" \"TAILS\" \"HEADS\" \"TAILS\" \"TAILS\" \"TAILS\" \"HEADS\"\n [73] \"TAILS\" \"HEADS\" \"TAILS\" \"TAILS\" \"HEADS\" \"TAILS\" \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\" \"TAILS\"\n [82] \"HEADS\" \"TAILS\" \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\" \"TAILS\" \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\"\n [91] \"HEADS\" \"TAILS\" \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\" \"TAILS\" \"HEADS\" \"TAILS\" \"HEADS\" \"HEADS\"\n[100] \"TAILS\"\n\n\nWe know that the true probability of the fair coin landing on heads is 0.5. Therefore, if we flip a fair coin 100 times, we should get 50 heads. However, we also know from above that these random draws are a bit noisy: we can get proportions that do not reflect the underlying probability of 0.5. What did we get in this draw?\n\ntable(coin_flip_100)\n\ncoin_flip_100\nHEADS TAILS \n   52    48 \n\n\nThe more flips we do, the closer we will get to that true probability distribution of 0.5. To demonstrate, let’s do 1,000,000 100-coin flip trials and record the number of heads we get each time:\n\ncoin_flip &lt;- function(possible_outcomes, n) {\n  \n  outcomes &lt;- sample(possible_outcomes, size = n, replace = T, prob = c(0.5, 0.5))\n  \n  return(table(outcomes)[\"HEADS\"])\n  \n}\n\nresults &lt;- tibble(trial = 1:1e6) |&gt; \n  rowwise() |&gt; \n  mutate(n_heads = coin_flip(possible_outcomes, 100))\n\nresults\n\n# A tibble: 1,000,000 × 2\n# Rowwise: \n   trial n_heads\n   &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt;\n 1     1      51\n 2     2      51\n 3     3      43\n 4     4      44\n 5     5      46\n 6     6      46\n 7     7      49\n 8     8      57\n 9     9      55\n10    10      52\n# ℹ 999,990 more rows\n\n\nWhat are the results of these repeated trials?\n\nggplot(results, aes(x = n_heads)) + \n  geom_histogram() + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 50) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Percentage of heads drawn in 100 coin-flip trial\",\n       y = \"Count of trials\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most common outcome of these one million 100-coin-flip trials is our true underlying proportion: \\(Pr(H, T) = \\{0.5, 0.5\\}\\). The next most common outcomes are very close to that true underlying proportion. If I were to select a trial at random from those one million we just conducted, I am most likely to get one that resulted in 50% heads or very close to 50% heads. This is because there are many more trials that resulted in and around 50% heads than did not.\nWe do get some trials in which we draw many more or far fewer than our expected 50 heads. We have some as low as 25 heads and some as large as 73 heads. But again, the number of heads recorded in most of our trials are clustered around our expected 50. The average number of heads drawn in all of our trials is 49.990517 heads which is really, really close to our known parameter of 0.5 or 50%. Yay!\nSo, even with representative and large samples you will get some error. That’s okay. As long as the mean of the sampling distribution of an infinite number of identical trials would equal the true population parameter, we have an unbiased statistic that we can use to infer things about our population of interest. Here, each of the outcomes of our trials - including those ones that resulted in 25 heads and 73 heads - are unbiased statistics because the mean of infinite identical trials would be 50 heads.\nSampling distributions\nLet’s move on from coin flips. Suppose that we want to know how many Americans identify as Democrats. We will return to the American National Election Survey to answer this question. The data are stored in the polisciols R package you installed last session.\nThis survey asks respondents whether they identify as a Democrat (this binary variable is 0 if not and 1 if they do). Let’s look at these data for our first five survey respondents:\n\nnes |&gt; \n  select(respondent_id, dem) |&gt; \n  head(5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  respondent_id dem  \n          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;\n1        200015 Other\n2        200022 Other\n3        200039 Other\n4        200046 Other\n5        200053 Other\n\n\nLet’s very cheekily pretend that this is a complete survey of the entire voting population of America. That way, we can pretend that we know the true proportion of US voters (our population of interest) who identify as Democrats (our parameter).\nWhat is that proportion?\n\ntabyl(nes, dem)\n\n      dem    n   percent\n    Other 6419 0.7752415\n Democrat 1861 0.2247585\n\n\nOkay, so let’s pretend that of all US voters identify as Democrats.\nWe can’t survey all voters, so instead we take a representative and large simple random sample from this population:\n\nnes_sample &lt;- nes |&gt; \n  select(respondent_id, dem) |&gt; \n  slice_sample(n = 3000)\n\nWe have taken a pure random sample of 3,000 individuals (or 36% of our population of 8,280 voters). Every voter (member of our population) had an equal probability of being picked for this sample.\nWhat proportion of this sample identify as Democrats?\n\ntabyl(nes_sample, dem)\n\n      dem    n   percent\n    Other 2329 0.7763333\n Democrat  671 0.2236667\n\n\n. Nice! But what if we took a different sample of 3,000?\n\nnes_sample_2 &lt;- nes |&gt; \n  select(respondent_id, dem) |&gt; \n  slice_sample(n = 3000)\n\ntabyl(nes_sample_2, dem)\n\n      dem    n   percent\n    Other 2306 0.7686667\n Democrat  694 0.2313333\n\n\nWe get a different answer: . Of course! This is just like our different coin flip trials from above. Each resulted in a different number of heads. The more flips we do, the closer we get to the true underlying probability distribution.\nLet’s take 1,000 different samples of 3,000 US voters and see what we get:\n\ndem_survey &lt;- function(df, n) {\n  \n  slice_sample(df, n = n) |&gt; \n    tabyl(dem) |&gt; \n    filter(dem == \"Democrat\") |&gt; \n    pull(percent)\n  \n}\n\nnes_samples_1000 &lt;- tibble(survey = 1:1000) |&gt; \n  rowwise() |&gt; \n  mutate(prop_dem = dem_survey(select(nes, respondent_id, dem), 3000)) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\nnes_samples_1000\n\n# A tibble: 1,000 × 2\n   survey prop_dem\n    &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1      1    0.235\n 2      2    0.217\n 3      3    0.218\n 4      4    0.219\n 5      5    0.236\n 6      6    0.228\n 7      7    0.232\n 8      8    0.230\n 9      9    0.224\n10     10    0.228\n# ℹ 990 more rows\n\n\n\nggplot(nes_samples_1000, aes(x = prop_dem)) + \n  geom_histogram() + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = tabyl(nes, dem) |&gt; filter(dem == 1) |&gt; pull(percent), \n             colour = \"lightblue\", \n             linewidth = 2) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(nes_samples_1000$prop_dem), \n             colour = \"pink\",\n             linewidth = 2) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Proportion of respondents who identify as Democrats\",\n       y = \"Count of trials\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn average, 22.45% of US voters in our 1,000 samples of 3,000 US voters identified as Democrats. This is shown by the pink line in the graph above. Our (cheeky) population proportion is (shown by the blue line in the graph above).\nYay! These are very, very close to each other and we only did 1,000 samples. If we took more and more samples, the average proportion of respondents who identify as Democrats in those trials would get increasingly close to our population’s proportion of Democrats. In fact, theoretically, if we took an infinite number of samples from these 8,280 observations, the average of the proportion of individuals who identify as Democrats in each of those infinite samples would equal exactly the population’s proportion: . Further, we know that the proportions found in each of those trials would be normally distributed around that mean, with the most common outcomes sitting at or very close to the mean.\nAs long as our sample of our population is large and randomly drawn, we know enough about its shape and central point to use it to infer what is going on in the population. When your sample is large and representative (read: randomly drawn), your sampling distribution will be approximately Normally distributed. This follows from the Central Limit Theorem. The center will be at (or very, very close to) the population mean. This follows from the Law of Large Numbers.\nInferring from a single “trial”\nIn a lot of (social) science research it is not practical or, in some cases, possible to do many trials. For example, a lot of us study the onset, conduct, and termination of wars. Unlike a game of chess, you cannot reset and run a war many times in order to get your sampling distribution of your variable of interest.\nFurther, we often do not know the shape or size of our population. For example, the best guess we have of the demographics of the US population comes from the census. But this misses a lot of people. For example, if you want to study houselessness, you might need to rely on surveys of samples of people that may or may not be representative of this difficult to reach population of people.\nA lot of the time; therefore, you will have one data point: one mean, one proportion, one count. To use this one data point to infer something about our population of interest, we need to use some of lessons that we learned from above and make some pretty important assumptions.\nLet’s return to our survey work above. We took 1,000 different samples of 3,000 US voters. We asked each of those US voters whether they identified as Democrats. We then found the proportion of the 3,000 respondents who identified as Democrats in each of our 1,000 different samples. We then took the average of those 1,000 different proportions and compared it to our population average. In line with the Central Limit Theorem and Law of Large Numbers, we found that the average of our sample statistics was very, very close to our population parameter.\nOkay, now imagine that you could only run one of those trials. Let’s select one at random:\n\nnes_single &lt;- slice_sample(nes_samples_1000)\nnes_single\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  survey prop_dem\n   &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    276    0.219\n\n\nHow close is this single sample statistic to the population parameter of ? Pretty close! In fact, as discussed above, you are more likely to get a sample statistic close to the population parameter than not.\nRemember, when we ran multiple trials we got many sample statistics that were clustered around the population mean:\n\nggplot(nes_samples_1000, aes(x = prop_dem)) + \n  geom_histogram() + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = tabyl(nes, dem) |&gt; filter(dem == 1) |&gt; pull(percent)) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Proportion of respondents who identify as Democrat\",\n       y = \"Count of trials\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, if you were to pick one of these trials at random, you are more likely to pick one with a sample statistic that is close to the population parameter than not. Convenient!\nHow confident can we be in our statistic?\nThat being said, we could get unlucky and have drawn a large and representative sample that sits at one of those extreme values. How confident can we be that our single sample statistic is close to the population parameter?\n\nggplot() + \n  stat_slab(\n    aes(x = rnorm(n = 1e6, mean = 5, sd = 2),\n        fill_ramp = after_stat(x &lt; -1.96 | x &gt; 1.96)), fill = met.brewer(\"Egypt\")[2]\n  ) + \n  scale_fill_ramp_discrete(range = c(1, 0.2), guide = \"none\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor normally distributed data approximately 95% of the data fall within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean (the medium blue). So, if we assume that the statistic we get from our large and representative sample is our “best guess” at the population parameter, we can center our theoretical sampling distribution around this point. We know that these data are Normally distributed. We can use what we know about Normal distributions to identify the boundaries around which we are confident some proportion of all statistics from an infinite number of identically drawn samples would fall.\nLet’s make this more concrete by going back to a single random sample of 3,000 respondents from the NES survey. Let’s draw that sample:\n\nnes_sample &lt;- sample_n(nes, 3000) |&gt; \n  select(respondent_id, dem)\n\nhead(nes_sample)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  respondent_id dem     \n          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;   \n1        204130 Other   \n2        217754 Other   \n3        423955 Other   \n4        316828 Democrat\n5        212681 Democrat\n6        222824 Other   \n\n\nIn this sample, of respondents identify as Democrats. This is our best guess at our parameter of interest: the proportion of US voters who identify as Democrats.\nUsing what we know from above, what would our distribution of proportions look like if this was not the (average) proportion drawn from one trial but instead it was the average proportion drawn from an infinite number of identical trials? Well, those proportions would be Normally distributed around that center point. To fill in that blank, we need one additional piece of information: the standard deviation (or spread) of those points around that center point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen we are looking at the standard deviation of the sampling distribution, we refer to it as the standard error.\n\n\nThe formula for working out the standard error of a proportion (such as the proportion of a population who identify as Democrats) is:\n\\[\nse(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\hat{p}\\) is the sample proportion (here: ).\n\np_hat &lt;- tabyl(nes_sample, dem) |&gt; \n  filter(dem == \"Democrat\") |&gt; \n  pull(percent)\n\nn &lt;- 3000\n\nse &lt;- sqrt((p_hat * (1 - p_hat)) / n)\nse\n\n[1] 0.007725856\n\n\nNow, let’s use this information to draw many different hypothetical proportions of respondents who identify as Democrats in many different hypothetical samples:\n\nggplot(tibble(x = rnorm(1e6, mean = p_hat, sd = se)), aes(x = x)) + \n  stat_halfeye(.width = c(0.95, 0.68)) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Proportion of respondents who identify as Democrats\",\n       caption = \"Median and mean shown with point. One and two standard deviations are shown by the black bars.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, if our sample is large and random and we were to draw it many different times (here, 1,000,000 times), we would get a sampling distribution of proportions that resembles the one presented above. This variation is due to random error. There is nothing wrong with our research design or sampling method.\nWe can use what we know about Normal distributions to say that approximately 95% of these hypothetical proportions of people who identify as Democrats fall within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean, or:\n\nlower_95 &lt;- p_hat - 1.96 * se\nlower_95\n\n[1] 0.218524\n\nupper_95 &lt;- p_hat + 1.96 * se\nupper_95\n\n[1] 0.2488093\n\n\nThese boundaries are marked by the thinner black line on the graph above.\nWe are putting a lot of stead in our single sample. That’s okay as long as your sample is large and representative. So, let’s return to the problem faced by pollsters when trying to determine support for Kamala Harris prior to the election. As long as those pollsters took a large and representative sample of the population of US voters, they can assume that the statistic they derive from their survey - the proportion of those surveyed who intended to vote for Harris - is most likely to be equal to the proportion of US voters who intended to vote for Harris. They will know this with some level of confidence, based on the size of and variation within their sample."

    "text": "Introduction\nToday, I am going to introduce you to some of my most widely used functions in R. The dplyr R package, which houses these functions, focuses on providing you with some very helpful tools to tidy your data. This step in the data analysis process is critical, and often one of the most time consuming, so let’s get started!\nR objects\nAs a reminder, objects sit in R’s memory. You can see which ones exist in your current session and their values over in the environment tab.\nTo create a new object, use: &lt;-. You can update that object at any time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSome people use = instead of &lt;-. I strongly recommend against this. It makes your script difficult to read, and it can lead to syntax errors.\n\n\nR functions\nFunctions are helpful short-hands that perform specific tasks in R. Many of these functions come straight out of the box with R. For example, you can run the following code without loading any packages into your current session:\n\nseq(1, 10)\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe seq() function takes three main arguments: a start value, end value, and interval value. Above I have asked it to start at 1 and end at 10. By default, its interval value is 1. Therefore, its output is every whole number from 1 to 10.\n\n\nYou can even create objects with R functions:\n\nx &lt;- seq(1, 10)\n\nx\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\nNow, the x object is a vector of all 10 whole numbers from 1 to 10.\nData\nAs mentioned above, we are going to be using the Gapminder project’s data on countries’ health and wealth to explore data transformation. Happily, there is an R package that provides that data for us. We will now install it:\n\ninstall.packages(\"gapminder\")\n\nNext, you want to create a new script for this session. At the top of that script, include the code to load in the packages we will be using today:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gapminder)\n\nYou can now access the Gapminder data directly:\n\ngapminder\n\n# A tibble: 1,704 × 6\n   country     continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n   &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Afghanistan Asia       1952    28.8  8425333      779.\n 2 Afghanistan Asia       1957    30.3  9240934      821.\n 3 Afghanistan Asia       1962    32.0 10267083      853.\n 4 Afghanistan Asia       1967    34.0 11537966      836.\n 5 Afghanistan Asia       1972    36.1 13079460      740.\n 6 Afghanistan Asia       1977    38.4 14880372      786.\n 7 Afghanistan Asia       1982    39.9 12881816      978.\n 8 Afghanistan Asia       1987    40.8 13867957      852.\n 9 Afghanistan Asia       1992    41.7 16317921      649.\n10 Afghanistan Asia       1997    41.8 22227415      635.\n# ℹ 1,694 more rows\n\n\nAbove, R prints out some useful information about our data. First, we learn that it is a tibble. This is the tidyverse version of a data frame.\nSecond, we learn how many rows and columns are included in our data set. We have 1,704 rows and 6 columns.\nNext, we learn the column (or variable) titles:\n\ncolnames(gapminder)\n\n[1] \"country\"   \"continent\" \"year\"      \"lifeExp\"   \"pop\"       \"gdpPercap\"\n\n\nNext, we see some funny looking three letter words under each column name. These refer to the column’s data type. We will discuss these below.\nFinally, we see the first few rows of our data set. We can see that each row provides a country’s information in a single year.\nData types\nThose funny three-letter words refer to the column’s data type. In this data set, we have three different types:\n\n&lt;fct&gt;, which stands for factor (R’s word for categorical variable)\n&lt;int&gt;, which stands for integer\n&lt;dbl&gt;, which stands for double (or real number)\n\nSome other common data types include:\n\n&lt;chr&gt;, which stands for character (or string)\n&lt;dttm&gt;, which stands for date-time\n&lt;lgl&gt;, which stands for local (which can only be TRUE or FALSE)\n\nData types are important because each column can only contain one data type. You cannot, for example, include a character in an integer column (imagine trying to run some calculation on that column: how would R treat the stray character value?).\n\ndplyr basics\nNow we know a little bit more about our data set, we are going to use it to explore five of the most commonly used functions in R:\n\nfilter()\narrange()\nselect()\nmutate()\nsummarise()\nExercises\nWhat is the unit of observation for the gapminder data set?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your answer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unit of observation is country-year.\n\n\n\nHow many country-years are included in the gapminder data set?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnrow(gapminder)\n\n[1] 1704\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich two variables in the gapminder data set are factors?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your answer\n\n\n\n\n\ncountry and continent are factors (or categorical variables)."

    "section": "Plotting your data",
    "text": "Plotting your data\nNext, we need to plot our data. We will use the ggplot2 package to do this. ggplot2 is a wonderfully intuitive and flexible data visualization tool. It is used widely.\nggplot2 works by building up data visualizations in layers. We will start with our blank canvas:\n\nggplot(data = mpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we have run the ggplot() function. We have included one argument, data. This is the data frame that includes all the data we want to visualize.\nNext, we need to let ggplot() know which variables we would like to visualize and where we would like them to go. We do this through ggplot()’s mapping argument:\n\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot() has now added some structure to our blank canvas. The displ variable is mapped onto the x-axis and the hwy variable is mapped to the y-axis. The mapping argument took a function, aes(), as its value. These are the aesthetics of your plot.\nNext, we need to visualize each data point. We want to produce a scatter plot, so we will add the relevant `ggplot` geometric object to our plot:\n\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll geometric objects start with geom_. Here are some examples:\n\ngeom_line() plots a line graph\ngeom_col() plots a column graph\ngeom_histogram() plots a histogram.\n\nWe now have a basic plot of our data. We can see a distinct relationship between a car’s engine size and its fuel use: cars with larger engines tend to travel fewer miles on the highway for each gallon of fuel than cars with smaller engines. This supports my hypothesis. Happy days!\nWe can even use ggplot() to visualize this general trend:\n\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, I have used geom_smooth to add a line to my plot that summarizes the relationship between our two variables. I asked it to draw a straight line by setting the argument method to \"lm\" (which stands for linear model).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe will talk a lot more about linear models during this course. Sit tight!\n\n\nAlthough this general trend is interesting, I suspect there are some important differences in this relationship between the different classes of cars. We can quickly check if this is the case by adding a visual cue of those different classes to our plot:\nFirst, I will colour each car’s data point based on its class:\n\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = class)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that I have introduced a new aesthetic to the model: colour. In doing so, I have told ggplot() to vary each data point’s colour based on its class. Each car is classified into one of the following seven classes:\n\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 1\n  class     \n  &lt;chr&gt;     \n1 compact   \n2 midsize   \n3 suv       \n4 2seater   \n5 minivan   \n6 pickup    \n7 subcompact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI, an Australian, am not afraid of my “u”s. Nor, is R! Both American English and “ahem” ~ proper ~ English work in R. For example, you can substitute my colour for color.\n\n\nWe can extend this grouping to all of our layers:\n\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = class)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimiarly, we can isolate which aesthetics apply to which layers by moving the aes() mapping from ggplot() to the specific layer to which we would like to apply it. Remember, ggplot2 is very flexible!\n\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + \n  geom_point(aes(colour = class)) + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll aesthetics supplied to the top ggplot() function will be inherited by the layers that proceed it unless you specify otherwise.\n\n\nExercise\nMake a scatter plot of hwy vs cyl.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(mpg, mapping = aes(x = hwy, y = cyl)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if you make a scatter plot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your answer\n\n\n\n\n\nScatter plots are best used to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables. These variables have an inherent order to them, allowing us to see how the relationship changes as each grows or shrinks. class and drv are unordered categorical variables, so their order in relation to each other is not meaningful.\n\nggplot(mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = drv)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does the following give an error and how would you fix it?\n\nggplot(data = mpg) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways read error messages carefully. They often tell you - in plain language - what the problem is and how to fix it. Here, we can see that “geom_point() requires the following missing aesthetics: x and y”. So, to fix it, we need to supply those aesthetics. For example:\n\nggplot(mpg, mapping = aes(x = hwy, y = cyl)) + \n  geom_point()"

    "section": "Styling your plot",
    "text": "Styling your plot\nYou have now learnt how to plot your data using ggplot2. However, the default styling leaves a little to be desired. We will now learn how to personalize your plots.\nFirst, we need to add some more information to our plot to make it easier to interpret. We will start with some more useful labels:\n\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + \n  geom_point(mapping = aes(colour = class)) + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Engine displacement and highway miles per gallon\",\n    subtitle = \"Values for seven different classes of cars\",\n    x = \"Engine displacement (L)\",\n    y = \"Highway miles per gallon\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we want to adjust what our plots look like. You can do this to highlight certain elements of your data:\n\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + \n  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class == \"2seater\")) + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Engine displacement and highway miles per gallon\",\n    subtitle = \"Values for seven different classes of cars\",\n    x = \"Engine displacement (L)\",\n    y = \"Highway miles per gallon\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr to simply make the graph more appealing to look at:\n\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + \n  geom_point(colour = \"pink\") + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Engine displacement and highway miles per gallon\",\n    subtitle = \"Values for seven different classes of cars\",\n    x = \"Engine displacement (L)\",\n    y = \"Highway miles per gallon\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess is often more when it comes to data visualization. Your audience will find it easier to learn about the relationships you want to highlight when your plot is not cluttered with stylistic elements.\nWe can easily strip away a lot of the default ggplot() styling using the theme_minimal() function:\n\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + \n  geom_point(mapping = aes(colour = class)) + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Engine displacement and highway miles per gallon\",\n    subtitle = \"Values for seven different classes of cars\",\n    x = \"Engine displacement (L)\",\n    y = \"Highway miles per gallon\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many preset ggplot2 themes available. You can check them out in the ggplot documentation.\nLike any R function, the ggplot2 theme_X() series of functions are running a more verbose set of R code in the background. You can add in this code directly using the theme() function to control the look of your plot.

    "text": "Working with categorical data\nSo far, we have looked at plotting the relationship between two continuous variables. We need different plot types to visualize categorical data.\nFirst, let’s take a look at some categorical variables in our mpg data set:\n\n\n# A tibble: 234 × 3\n   manufacturer model      drv  \n   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;\n 1 audi         a4         f    \n 2 audi         a4         f    \n 3 audi         a4         f    \n 4 audi         a4         f    \n 5 audi         a4         f    \n 6 audi         a4         f    \n 7 audi         a4         f    \n 8 audi         a4 quattro 4    \n 9 audi         a4 quattro 4    \n10 audi         a4 quattro 4    \n# ℹ 224 more rows\n\n\nHere, we have information on each car’s manufacturer, its model name, and its drive train type (front-wheel, rear-wheel, or four-wheel drive).\nWhat is the most popular drive train type among our sample of car models? We can quickly answer this question by visualizing the count of the number of different models in each drive train type:\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv)) + \n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like front-wheel drives (f) are just the most popular type, quickly followed by four-wheel drives. We can reorder our x-axis to follow this ranking:\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = fct_infreq(drv))) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounts of our data can be very helpful for getting a sense of what is common (or not) among them. For example, I can use a histogram (which plots counts of the number of observations within bins of continuous variables) to see how my variable is distributed across all the range of its values. Here is that distribution for one of our continuous variables above, highway miles per gallon:\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this histogram, we learn that the car models in our sample tend to do between roughly 15 to 30 highway miles per gallon of fuel. A small number of cars are more efficient (can do up to over 40 miles with that one gallon). Similarly a small number of cars are very inefficient (only getting around 12 miles with that gallon).\nWe can get a similar, if cleaner, sense of this shape using a density plot:\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis density plot is showing the same data as the histogram, but it presents a smoother picture. This can often allow us to focus more easily on the shape of the distribution of our data. However, it can gloss over some important details in that distribution. For example, we get less of a sense of the trough (or low point) immediately after 20 miles per gallon in the density plot compared to the histogram.\nWe can also use these data visualizations to easily compare data. For example, here is the distribution of highway miles per gallon for cars according to their drive train type:\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, colour = drv, fill = drv)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe colour aesthetic controls the thin outline of the density plot. Adding the fill aesthetic makes the groups easier to see. geom_density()’s alpha argument controls the transparency of each density plot.\n\n\nExercise\nPlot the number of observations in each category of a categorical variable in the mpg data set. Make sure to use an appropriate graph type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv)) + \n  geom_bar()"

    "text": "Bivariate relationships\nHow do two variables move with one another? When when goes up, does the other go down, up, or not really move at all? How dramatic is this shift?\nThe type of variables we have determines how we can answer this question. To begin, we will explore the relationship between two continuous variables. Later in the section, we will look at how to explore the relationship between a continuous and categorical variable.\nWe will return to the relationship between a country’s wealth and health. This question was made popular by the Gapminder project. We were introduced to it during the Transformations section in Session One.\nCollecting our data\nFirst, we need to collect our data. Following the Gapminder project, we measure each country’s health by its average life expectancy and its wealth by its GDP per capita. We will use wbstats::wb_data() to pull these data directly from the World Bank.\n\ngapminder_df &lt;- wb_data(\n  indicator = c(\"SP.DYN.LE00.IN\", \"NY.GDP.PCAP.CD\"),\n  start_date = 2016,\n  end_date = 2016\n) |&gt; \n  # Give these variables more friendly names\n  rename(\n    life_exp = SP.DYN.LE00.IN,\n    gdp_per_cap = NY.GDP.PCAP.CD\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    # Create a new variable that is GDP per capita logged\n    log_gdp_per_cap = log(gdp_per_cap),\n    # Add each country's region to the data set\n    region = countrycode(country, \"country.name\", \"region\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  relocate(region, .after = country)\n\ngapminder_df\n\n# A tibble: 217 × 8\n   iso2c iso3c country         region  date gdp_per_cap life_exp log_gdp_per_cap\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 AW    ABW   Aruba           Latin…  2016      27442.     75.6           10.2 \n 2 AF    AFG   Afghanistan     South…  2016        522.     63.1            6.26\n 3 AO    AGO   Angola          Sub-S…  2016       1808.     61.1            7.50\n 4 AL    ALB   Albania         Europ…  2016       4124.     78.9            8.32\n 5 AD    AND   Andorra         Europ…  2016      40130.

The easiest way to determine this is to visualize these two variables:\n\nggplot(gapminder_df, aes(x = gdp_per_cap, y = life_exp)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"GDP per capita (USD current)\",\n       y = \"Average life expectancy (years)\") + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere seems to be a good case that there is a strong relationship between a country’s GDP per capita (wealth) and its average life expectancy (health). It appears that we expect citizens that live in countries that have larger GPD per capita to live longer, on average. But this relationship is not linear (a straight line drawn through them will not summarize this relationship very well).\nBecause we want to explore linear relationships at this stage of the course, we will look at the logged GDP per capita variable:\n\nggplot(gapminder_df, aes(x = log_gdp_per_cap, y = life_exp)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Logged GDP per capita\",\n       y = \"Average life expectancy (years)\") + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can transform your data to make it easier to work with. Just remember that you now need to talk in terms of logged GDP per capita instead of GDP per capita.\n\n\nI can imagine drawing a straight line among these points that summarizes how they vary with each other. It appears that as a country’s logged GDP per capita increases, so too does the average life expectancy of its population. As wealth increases, so too does health. These increases are consistent across each interval increase in wealth.\nWell, that was easy! What is the relationship between health and wealth? They increase with each other.\nHow can we measure the strength of that relationship?\nNow we need some way of measuring the strength of the relationship. In other words, what amount of the variation in countries’ average life expectancy is associated with variation in their GDP per capita? We can measure the strength of this association using correlations. The correlation coefficient tells us how closely variables relate to one another. It tells us both the strength and direction of the association.\n\nStrength: how closely are these values tied to one another. Measured from 0 to |1|, with values closer to 0 indicating a very weak relationship and values closer to |1| indicating a very strong relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhat are those funny looking |s? They represent the absolute value, which is shorthand for the number regardless of its sign. To demonstrate, |1| is the absolute value of 1 and -1.\n\n\n\nDirection: do both \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) change in the same direction? Positive correlations show that when \\(X\\) increases (decreases), so does \\(Y\\). Negative correlations show that when \\(X\\) increases (decreases), \\(Y\\) decreases (increases). In other words, they move in different directions.\n\nWhat is the correlation between logged GDP per capita and life expectancy?\n\ncor(gapminder_df$log_gdp_per_cap, gapminder_df$life_exp, use = \"complete.obs\")\n\n[1] 0.8506936\n\n\nAs expected, the relationship is positive and strong.\nBuilding a generalizable description of this relationship\nWe have very quickly gained the skills to determine whether the relationship between two variables is positive, negative, or non-existent. We have also learnt how to describe the strength of that relationship. To that end, we are now able to describe the bivariate relationship between health and wealth as a positive and strong one.\nThis is useful, but we tend to need a more concrete way of describing the relationship between two variables. For example, what if a policy-maker comes up to you and asks what you think the effect of a $1,000 increase in a country’s GDP per capita will do to its average life expectancy? We can build simple models of this relationship to provide that policy-maker with a prediction of what we might expect to happen, on average. Further, we can use the model to describe the relationship between these two variables in a generalized way. If a new country were to spring into existence, we can use our knowledge of its GDP per capita to determine how long we might expect its citizens to live.\nOLS and linear regression\nLooking back at our data, we can image a straight line running between each country’s plotted average life expectancy and GDP per capita. Let’s draw that line:\n\nggplot(gapminder_df, aes(x = log_gdp_per_cap, y = life_exp)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Logged GDP per capita\",\n       y = \"Average life expectancy (years)\") + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can, of course, draw many different lines through these points. Each of us has probably drawn a slightly different line in our heads. Which is the best line?\nOrdinary least squares (OLS) regression provides an answer. OLS regression draws the line that minimizes the distance between itself and all of the data points. That line can take many shapes, including a straight line, an S, a frowney face, and smiley face, etc.\nLooking at our data above, it appears that a straight line is the best line to draw.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOverfitting involves fitting a model (or drawing a line through our data) that misses the forest for the trees. You can draw all kinds of shapes through those data that perhaps result in a smaller distance between itself and each dot. In fact, if you draw a line that connects all of those dots there will be no difference between your line and the data points.\nHowever, this model will be too focused on the data we have at hand. Our model will have no idea what to do with any new data points we introduce. This is bad! Your aim here is to produce a generalizable model of the relationship between these two variables, not to draw a line that connects this particular constellation of dots.\n\n\nOkay, so a straight line is the best type of line to draw. But there are still many, many different straight lines that we can draw. Which straight line is best? Remember, OLS regression finds the line that minimizes the distance between itself and all of the data points. Let’s step through this. Look at the graph above.\n\nDraw a line through those dots. Pick a line, any line!\nCalculate the distance between each dot and the line.\nSum up the absolute values of those distances. Remember, we just care about the distance, so we don’t need to worry about whether or not the dots are above or below the line.\nRepeat steps 1 - 3 many, many, many times.\nPick the line with the smallest sum of distances (the results from step 3).\n\nPhew, this seems tedious. Happily, maths and R are to the rescue. Here is the line that minimizes those distances (all with the addition of one extra line of code).\n\nggplot(gapminder_df, aes(x = log_gdp_per_cap, y = life_exp)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = F) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Logged GDP per capita\",\n       y = \"Average life expectancy (years)\") + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimating a linear model in R\nHow did R do this? To answer this, we will first do some review.\nRemember (back to your high school maths classes) the general equation for a line:\n\\[\ny = a + mx\n\\]\nRead this as: the value of \\(y\\) is the sum of some constant, \\(a\\), and some \\(x\\) variable that has been transformed by some slope value \\(m\\).\nRemember that the slope constant, \\(m\\), tells you how much \\(y\\) changes for every one unit increase in \\(x\\).\nSo, if:\n\\[\ny = 10 + 2x\n\\]\nThen, when \\(x = 20\\):\n\\[\ny = 10 + 2*20 = 50\n\\]\nFor many values of \\(x\\):\n\nggplot(tibble(x = 0:50, y = 10 + 2*x), aes(x = x, y = y)) + \n  geom_line(colour = \"lightgrey\", linewidth = 3) + \n  geom_point() + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, let’s substitute in our variables of interest. Our \\(y\\) variable is a country’s average life expectancy and our \\(x\\) variable is that country’s logged GDP per capita.\n\\[\nlife Exp_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 logGdpPerCap_i + \\epsilon\n\\]\nRead this as: country \\(i\\)’s average life expectancy is a function of some constant (\\(\\beta_0\\)) and its logged GDP per capita transformed by some value \\(\\beta_1\\) with some random error (\\(\\epsilon\\)).\nLet’s imagine that this relationship is accurately described by the following formula:\n\\[\nlife Exp_i = 30 + 4 * logGdpPerCap_i\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe will get to that pesky error term in just a minute.\n\n\nThen, our model would predict the following average life expectancy for countries with log GDPs per capita between 0 and 20:\n\nggplot(\n  tibble(log_gdp_per_cap = 0:20, life_exp = 30 + 4*log_gdp_per_cap), \n  aes(x = log_gdp_per_cap, y = life_exp)\n) + \n  geom_line(colour = \"lightgrey\", linewidth = 3) + \n  geom_point() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Logged GDP per capita\",\n       y = \"Average life expectancy (years)\") + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA country with a logged GDP per capita of 5 (the equivalent of a GDP per capita of $148.41) has a predicted average life expectancy of 50 years, or \\(30 + 4*5\\).\nA country with a logged GDP per capita of 10 (the equivalent of a GDP per capita of $22,026.47) has a predicted average life expectancy of 70 years, or \\(30 + 4*10\\).\nDoes this accurately describe what we see in our data? What is the average life expectancy for countries with roughly $22,000 GDP per capita?\n\ncountries_10 &lt;- filter(gapminder_df, gdp_per_cap &gt; 21000 & gdp_per_cap &lt; 23000)\n\ncountries_10\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 8\n  iso2c iso3c country          region  date gdp_per_cap life_exp log_gdp_per_cap\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 KN    KNA   St. Kitts and N… Latin…  2016      21388.     71.7            9.97\n2 SA    SAU   Saudi Arabia     Middl…  2016      21516.     77.1            9.98\n3 SI    SVN   Slovenia         Europ…  2016      21448.     81.2            9.97\n\n\nWe predicted 70 years, but our data suggest that these countries have closer to an average of 77 years. Why do we have this difference?\nWell, we probably haven’t produced the best model we can (this isn’t the best line!). We just picked those numbers (\\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\)) out of thin air. Let’s fit a linear OLS regression and see if we improve our ability to predict what we have seen in the wild.\nHow do we calculate the constant (\\(\\beta_0\\)) using OLS regression?\nRemember, OLS regression simply finds the line that minimizes the distance between itself and all the data points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe constant that minimizes this distance is the mean of \\(Y\\) minus \\(\\beta_1\\) times the mean of \\(X\\). You can prove this using some calculus. We won’t do that here, but feel free to Google it if you are very interested.\n\n\nSo, the constant that best predicts a country’s average life expectancy based on its logged GDP per capita is equal to the average life expectancy across our sample (72.3 years) minus the average logged GDP per capita ($8.80, or $6,652.93 GDP per capita) transformed by \\(\\beta_1\\).\nSo…\nHow do we calculate the coefficient \\(\\beta_1\\)?\nThe regression slope is the correlation coefficient between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) multiplied by the standard deviation of \\(Y\\) divided by the standard deviation of \\(X\\).\nEw… Let’s step through that.\nRemember, the correlation coefficient simply measures how \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) change together. Does \\(Y\\) increase when \\(X\\) increases? How strong is this relationship?\nThe standard deviations of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) just measure how spread out they are.\nBringing these together, we are interested in how much \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) change with each other moderated by how much they change independently of each other.\nFormally:\n\\[\n\\beta_1 = (\\frac{\\Sigma(\\frac{x_i - \\bar{x}}{s_X})(\\frac{y_i - \\bar{y}}{s_Y})}{n - 1})(\\frac{s_Y}{s_X}) = \\frac{\\Sigma(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\Sigma(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\n\\]\nHappily R does all of this for us.\nLet’s fit that model already!\n\nm &lt;- lm(life_exp ~ log_gdp_per_cap, data = gapminder_df)\n\nm\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = life_exp ~ log_gdp_per_cap, data = gapminder_df)\n\nCoefficients:\n    (Intercept)  log_gdp_per_cap  \n         32.794            4.521  \n\n\nOkay, so the line of best fit describing the relationship between average life expectancy and logged GDP per capita is:\n\\[\nlife Exp_i = 32.9 + 4.5 * logGdpPerCap_i + \\epsilon\n\\]\nThat’s it! We now have a model of the relationship between a country’s average life expectancy and its logged GDP per capita. This model is informed by what we actually observed in the world. It carefully balances our need to accurately describe what we have observed and to develop something that is generalizable.\nThe above model output is difficult to read. It will not be accepted by any journal or professor. Luckily, we can use modelsummary::modelsummary() to easily generate a professionally formatted table.\n\nmodelsummary(\n  m, \n  statistic = NULL,\n  coef_rename = c(\"log_gdp_per_cap\" = \"GDP per capita (logged)\"),\n  gof_map = \"nobs\"\n)\n\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n \n                (1)\n              \n\n\n(Intercept)\n                  32.794\n                \n\nGDP per capita (logged)\n                  4.521\n                \n\nNum.Obs.\n                  203\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAlways make sure to change your variable names from ones that are easily read by a computer (for example, log_gdp_per_cap to one that are easily read by your human reader (for example, GDP per capita (logged)).\n\n\nAssumptions\nNote that OLS regression, particularly linear regression, requires that you make a lot of important assumptions about the relationship between your two variables. For example, we need to assume that the best line to fit is a straight one. We also assume that the best way to generate and describe the relationship across all observations is to fit the line that minimizes the distance between itself and the observed values or dots.\nThere are other approaches to determining the “best” line. These include maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian statistics. We won’t discuss these approaches in this class. It’s worth noting here; however, that OLS regression requires a whole bunch of assumptions that may or may not be appropriate to your research question or theory. This class prepares you to grapple with those questions and to appropriately use these tools in your own research.\nPrediction and performance\nOkay, so we now have a model that describes the relationship between our outcome of interest (health) and our independent variable of interest (wealth). We can use this to predict our outcome of interest for different values of our independent variable. For example, what do we predict to be the average life expectancy of a country with a GDP per capita of $20,000?\nbroom::tidy(m) makes this model object a lot easier (tidier) to work with.\n\nm_res &lt;- tidy(m)\nm_res\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term            estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)        32.8      1.75       18.8 4.18e-46\n2 log_gdp_per_cap     4.52     0.197      22.9 4.80e-58\n\n\nFirst, let’s pull out the estimated constant (or intercept or \\(\\beta_0\\)) for our calculations.\n\nbeta_0 &lt;- m_res |&gt; \n  filter(term == \"(Intercept)\") |&gt; \n  pull(estimate)\n\nbeta_0\n\n[1] 32.79384\n\n\nNext, let’s pull out the estimated coefficient for (logged) GDP per capita:\n\nbeta_1 &lt;- m_res |&gt; \n  filter(term == \"log_gdp_per_cap\") |&gt; \n  pull(estimate)\n\nbeta_1\n\n[1] 4.520601\n\n\nFinally, we can plug this in to our model:\n\\[\nlife Exp_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 logGdpPerCap_i\n\\]\n\nlife_exp_20000 &lt;- beta_0 + beta_1 * log(20000)\nlife_exp_20000\n\n[1] 77.56355\n\n\nOn average, countries with GDPs per capita of $20,000 are predicted to have an average life expectancy of 78 years.\nLet’s take a look back at our data. Remember, these data describe what the World Bank actually observed for each country in 2016. How close is our predicted value to our observed values?\n\ncountries_10\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 8\n  iso2c iso3c country          region  date gdp_per_cap life_exp log_gdp_per_cap\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 KN    KNA   St. Kitts and N… Latin…  2016      21388.     71.7            9.97\n2 SA    SAU   Saudi Arabia     Middl…  2016      21516.     77.1            9.98\n3 SI    SVN   Slovenia         Europ…  2016      21448.     81.2            9.97\n\n\nAs above, our data suggest that these countries have closer to an average of 77 years. Although our model predicted an average life expectancy closer to this than our guess above (which predicted 70 years), we still have a gap. Why?\nOur model is an attempt to formalize our understanding of the general relationship between a country’s wealth and health. Plotting our model against the observed values we used to generate it illustrates this point well:\n\nggplot(gapminder_df, aes(x = log_gdp_per_cap, y = life_exp)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = log(20000)) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = life_exp_20000) + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = F) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Logged GDP per capita\",\n       y = \"Average life expectancy (years)\") + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe world is a complicated and messy place. There are many countries that have a GDP per capita of around $20,000 (those dots sitting around the vertical black line). They have a wide range of average life expectancy: look at their various placement along that vertical line. Some are higher than others.\nAlso, there are several countries with a wide range of logged GDP per capita that have an average life expectancy of 78 years (those sitting at or around the horizontal black line). These have a wide range of logged GDP per capita: some are further to the left than others.\nOur model is our best attempt at accounting for that diversity whilst still producing a useful summary of the relationship between health and wealth for those countries and all other countries with all observed values of GDP per capita.\nA bit of noise (or error) is expected. How much error is okay? This is a complicated question that has contested answers. Let’s start with actually measuring that error. Then we can chat about whether or not it’s small enough to allow us to be confident in our model.\nMeasuring error in our model\nReturning to our question above, how close are our predicted values to our observed values? For example, how far from the observed average life expectancy of countries with a GDP per capita of or close to $20,000 is 78 years?\nStart by working out the average life expectancy predicted by our model for the logged GDP per capita of all of our countries. We can then compare this to the average life expectancy actually observed in all these countries. We can predict values from a model using broom::augment():\n\naugment(m)\n\n# A tibble: 203 × 9\n   .rownames life_exp log_gdp_per_cap .fitted .resid    .hat .sigma   .cooksd\n   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 1             75.6           10.2     79.0 -3.38  0.00999   4.10 0.00347  \n 2 2             63.1            6.26    61.1  2.05  0.0192    4.10 0.00252  \n 3 3             61.1            7.50    66.7 -5.61  0.00850   4.08 0.00812  \n 4 4             78.9            8.32    70.4  8.43  0.00533   4.06 0.0114   \n 5 6             79.3           10.6     80.8 -1.51  0.0132    4.10 0.000921 \n 6 7             76.3            9.45    75.5  0.797 0.00609   4.10 0.000117 \n 7 8             74.7            8.17    69.7  4.95  0.00569   4.09 0.00421  \n 8 10            78.2            9.71    76.7  1.44  0.00712   4.10 0.000448 \n 9 11            82.4           10.8     81.7  0.753 0.0149    4.10 0.000260 \n10 12            81.6           10.7     81.2  0.406 0.0140    4.10 0.0000706\n# ℹ 193 more rows\n# ℹ 1 more variable: .std.resid &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nThis function is simply fitting our model (\\(life Exp_i = 32.9 + 4.5 * logGdpPerCap_i\\)) to each country’s logged GDP per capita.

Where the model has got it wrong, it has tended to overestimate life expectancy (note that the peak of the density curve sits above 0).\nCan you see for which points these large differences exist?\n\nggplot(gapminder_df, aes(x = log_gdp_per_cap, y = life_exp)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = F) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Logged GDP per capita\",\n       y = \"Average life expectancy (years)\") + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is causing these differences? A lot of your work as a political scientist is trying to answer this very question!\n(Random) error\nThe world is a messy and complicated place. Things often vary in random ways. That’s okay! It means that your observational data are going to move in funny and random ways. That’s okay too! As long as your model includes all of the systematic drivers of the thing you are interested in measuring (such as average life expectancy), we can accept a bit of random error.\nIn fact, we have already accounted for this. Remember that error term:\n\\[\nlife Exp_x = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 logGdpPerCap_x + \\epsilon\n\\]\nWe run into issues when there are non-random things bundled up into the difference between what our model predicts and what we actually observe. We will discuss this more in later sessions.\nA model-wide value for error\nWe often want to understand how the model has performed as a whole, rather than how well it predicts each individual observed data point. There are many different ways we can do this.\nSum of squared residuals (deviance)\nThe sum of squared residuals measures the total error in our model. Formally:\n\\[\n\\Sigma(y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2\n\\]\nWhere \\(y_i\\) is each observed value (the country’s actual average life expectancy) and \\(\\hat{y_i}\\) is each predicted value (the model’s estimate of country’s average life expectancy). We just add those all up to get a single measure of the model’s overall performance.\nRemember that we tend to square things when we don’t care about their direction. We don’t care that the predicted value is less or more than the observed value, just about how far they are from each other.\nWe can do this ourselves:\n\naugment(m) |&gt; \n  summarise(sum(.resid^2))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(.resid^2)`\n            &lt;dbl&gt;\n1           3366.\n\n\nOr we can use broom::glance():\n\nglance(m)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 12\n  r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic  p.value    df logLik   AIC   BIC\n      &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     0.724         0.722  4.09      526. 4.80e-58     1  -573. 1152. 1162.\n# ℹ 3 more variables: deviance &lt;dbl&gt;, df.residual &lt;int&gt;, nobs &lt;int&gt;\n\n\n\nglance(m) |&gt; \n  select(deviance)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  deviance\n     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    3366.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhere broom::tidy() gives us information about the coefficients of our model, broom::glance() gives us information on the model overall.\n\n\nThis is useful, but it is influenced by the units by which we measure our variables. If one model includes something like GDP which is includes values in the billions, we will get a very large sum of squared residuals. If another model includes something like percentage of as state’s citizens who will vote for Donald Trump, we will get a relatively small sum of squared residuals. What if we want to compare model performance in a meaningful way?\n\\(R^2\\)\nThe \\(R^2\\) value measures the amount of variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable. In our example, it measures how much the changes in countries’ average life expectancy is explained by the changes in their (logged) GDP per capita.\n\\[\nR^2 = 1 - \\frac{Unexplained\\ variation}{Total\\ variation}\n\\]\nThe \\(R^2\\) value is useful because it does not reflect the units of measurement used in our variables. Therefore, we can compare how well different models perform.\nThe \\(R^2\\) value has three component parts.\nTotal Sum of Squares (TSS)\nTSS measures the squared sum of the differences between all predicted values of the dependent variable and the mean of the dependent variable.\nExplained Sum of Squares (ESS)\nESS measures the sum of the squares of the deviations of the predicted values from the mean value of the dependent variable.\nResidual Sum of Squares (RSS)\nRSS measures the difference between the TSS and ESS. In other words, the error not explained by the model.\nFormally, the \\(R^2\\) value is:\n\\[\nR^2 = 1 - \\frac{RSS}{TSS} = 1 - \\frac{\\Sigma(y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2}{\\Sigma(y_i - \\hat{y})^2}\n\\]\nOr:\n\\[\nR^2 = \\frac{ESS}{TSS} = \\frac{\\Sigma(\\hat{y}_i - \\bar{y})^2}{\\Sigma(y_i - \\bar{y})^2}\n\\]\nOur model’s \\(R^2\\) can be accessed using broom::glance():\n\nglance(m) |&gt; \n  select(r.squared)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  r.squared\n      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     0.724\n\n\nAn \\(R^2\\) of one means that all changes in the dependent variable are completely explained by changes in the independent variable. Here, it would mean that all changes to a country’s average life expectancy are explained through changes to the country’s logged GDP per capita.\nAccording to our model, 72.4% of changes in a country’s average life expectancy are explained through changes to the country’s logged GDP per capita."

For example, observations in the weather data set, which provides information about the hourly weather across New York City’s airports, are uniquely identified by the airport (origin) and time the weather was recorded (time_hour):\n\nweather\n\n# A tibble: 26,115 × 15\n   origin  year month   day  hour  temp  dewp humid wind_dir wind_speed\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 EWR     2013     1     1     1  39.0  26.1  59.4      270      10.4 \n 2 EWR     2013     1     1     2  39.0  27.0  61.6      250       8.06\n 3 EWR     2013     1     1     3  39.0  28.0  64.4      240      11.5 \n 4 EWR     2013     1     1     4  39.9  28.0  62.2      250      12.7 \n 5 EWR     2013     1     1     5  39.0  28.0  64.4      260      12.7 \n 6 EWR     2013     1     1     6  37.9  28.0  67.2      240      11.5 \n 7 EWR     2013     1     1     7  39.0  28.0  64.4      240      15.0 \n 8 EWR     2013     1     1     8  39.9  28.0  62.2      250      10.4 \n 9 EWR     2013     1     1     9  39.9  28.0  62.2      260      15.0 \n10 EWR     2013     1     1    10  41    28.0  59.6      260      13.8 \n# ℹ 26,105 more rows\n# ℹ 5 more variables: wind_gust &lt;dbl&gt;, precip &lt;dbl&gt;, pressure &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   visib &lt;dbl&gt;, time_hour &lt;dttm&gt;\n\n\nWe can verify that each observation has a unique value as its primary key using count() and filter():\n\nairlines |&gt; \n  count(carrier) |&gt; \n  filter(n &gt; 1)\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 2\n# ℹ 2 variables: carrier &lt;chr&gt;, n &lt;int&gt;\n\nweather |&gt; \n  count(time_hour, origin) |&gt; \n  filter(n &gt; 1)\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 3\n# ℹ 3 variables: time_hour &lt;dttm&gt;, origin &lt;chr&gt;, n &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nIf you know that each row of your data set is a unique observation, you can create your own primary key using its row number:\n\nairlines |&gt; \n  mutate(id = row_number(), .before = 1)\n\n# A tibble: 16 × 3\n      id carrier name                       \n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                      \n 1     1 9E      Endeavor Air Inc.          \n 2     2 AA      American Airlines Inc.     \n 3     3 AS      Alaska Airlines Inc.       \n 4     4 B6      JetBlue Airways            \n 5     5 DL      Delta Air Lines Inc.       \n 6     6 EV      ExpressJet Airlines Inc.   \n 7     7 F9      Frontier Airlines Inc.     \n 8     8 FL      AirTran Airways Corporation\n 9     9 HA      Hawaiian Airlines Inc.     \n10    10 MQ      Envoy Air                  \n11    11 OO      SkyWest Airlines Inc.      \n12    12 UA      United Air Lines Inc.      \n13    13 US      US Airways Inc.            \n14    14 VX      Virgin America             \n15    15 WN      Southwest Airlines Co.     \n16    16 YV      Mesa Airlines Inc.         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBy default, if you create a new column using mutate() that column will be placed at the end of the tibble.

    "text": "Basic joins\nPrimary keys serve as your connection to foreign keys, which are the variables that allow you to uniquely identify observations within the data set you want to join to your original data set. For example, flights$carrier is a foreign key that connects to the primary key airlines$carrier.\nYou can join data sets using their primary and foreign keys using one of six join functions provided in the dplyr R package (which is loaded in with tidyverse). These are: left_join(), inner_join(), right_join(), full_join(), semi_join(), and anti_join(). All of these functions take two data frames (which I will refer to as primary and foreign) and return a data frame.\nMutating joins\nMutating joins create new columns by appending information in foreign to primary according to the key and join function you use. There are four mutating join functions: left_join(), right_join(), inner_join(), and full_join().\nleft_join() matches observations in primary and foreign by their keys, then copies all other variables in foreign to primary. The resulting data frame will always have the same number of rows as primary. For example, let’s join flights (which provides information on all flights that departed NYC airports in 2013) with airlines:\n\nflights |&gt; \n  left_join(airlines)\n\n# A tibble: 336,776 × 20\n    year month   day dep_time sched_dep_time dep_delay arr_time sched_arr_time\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;          &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n 1  2013     1     1      517            515         2      830            819\n 2  2013     1     1      533            529         4      850            830\n 3  2013     1     1      542            540         2      923            850\n 4  2013     1     1      544            545        -1     1004           1022\n 5  2013     1     1      554            600        -6      812            837\n 6  2013     1     1      554            558        -4      740            728\n 7  2013     1     1      555            600        -5      913            854\n 8  2013     1     1      557            600        -3      709            723\n 9  2013     1     1      557            600        -3      838            846\n10  2013     1     1      558            600        -2      753            745\n# ℹ 336,766 more rows\n# ℹ 12 more variables: arr_delay &lt;dbl&gt;, carrier &lt;chr&gt;, flight &lt;int&gt;,\n#   tailnum &lt;chr&gt;, origin &lt;chr&gt;, dest &lt;chr&gt;, air_time &lt;dbl&gt;, distance &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   hour &lt;dbl&gt;, minute &lt;dbl&gt;, time_hour &lt;dttm&gt;, name &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nWhen you run this in RStudio you will see the following message printed in your console:\nJoining with `by = join_by(carrier)`\nThis is letting you know the key left_join() used to match observations in flights with those in airlines.

For example, the airports data set contains information on all airports in the US, but the flights data set only includes information on NYC airports.

For example, the following will return all airports except those included in the flights data frame:\n\nairports |&gt; \n  anti_join(flights, by = join_by(faa == origin))\n\n# A tibble: 1,455 × 8\n   faa   name                             lat    lon   alt    tz dst   tzone    \n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                          &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    \n 1 04G   Lansdowne Airport               41.1  -80.6  1044    -5 A     America/…\n 2 06A   Moton Field Municipal Airport   32.5  -85.7   264    -6 A     America/…\n 3 06C   Schaumburg Regional             42.0  -88.1   801    -6 A     America/…\n 4 06N   Randall Airport                 41.4  -74.4   523    -5 A     America/…\n 5 09J   Jekyll Island Airport           31.1  -81.4    11    -5 A     America/…\n 6 0A9   Elizabethton Municipal Airport  36.4  -82.2  1593    -5 A     America/…\n 7 0G6   Williams County Airport         41.5  -84.5   730    -5 A     America/…\n 8 0G7   Finger Lakes Regional Airport   42.9  -76.8   492    -5 A     America/…\n 9 0P2   Shoestring Aviation Airfield    39.8  -76.6  1000    -5 U     America/…\n10 0S9   Jefferson County Intl           48.1 -123.    108    -8 A     America/…\n# ℹ 1,445 more rows\n\n\nHere is a visualization of what is going on with anti_join():\n\n\nSource: R4DS"

For example, I often need to build data sets that include information on all countries across some number of years. I like to create this “spine” independently of my data collection to make sure I am covering all country-years I expect to cover and not relying on my data source.\nFor example, I may want to look at delays across all airports in the US in the years 2018-2024. To build my spine, I would start with a list of all airports:\n\nairports\n\n# A tibble: 1,458 × 8\n   faa   name                             lat    lon   alt    tz dst   tzone    \n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                          &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    \n 1 04G   Lansdowne Airport               41.1  -80.6  1044    -5 A     America/…\n 2 06A   Moton Field Municipal Airport   32.5  -85.7   264    -6 A     America/…\n 3 06C   Schaumburg Regional             42.0  -88.1   801    -6 A     America/…\n 4 06N   Randall Airport                 41.4  -74.4   523    -5 A     America/…\n 5 09J   Jekyll Island Airport           31.1  -81.4    11    -5 A     America/…\n 6 0A9   Elizabethton Municipal Airport  36.4  -82.2  1593    -5 A     America/…\n 7 0G6   Williams County Airport         41.5  -84.5   730    -5 A     America/…\n 8 0G7   Finger Lakes Regional Airport   42.9  -76.8   492    -5 A     America/…\n 9 0P2   Shoestring Aviation Airfield    39.8  -76.6  1000    -5 U     America/…\n10 0S9   Jefferson County Intl           48.1 -123.    108    -8 A     America/…\n# ℹ 1,448 more rows\n\n\nNow, I want to create new rows for each airport and year between 2018 and 2024.
